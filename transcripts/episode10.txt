Oh that sounded pretty weak to me. Let's try it again. [cups his ear]
That's better. Now who are all these people making a ruckus and tracking up my floor? [points to a young boy] You! What's your name?
And when are you gonna get taller, huh? What are you, fifteen, sixteen years old?
Well, all right then, you're fine. All right, lets go. Come on, I'm a busy man. I am, after all, the President of Bulgaria.
Now, wait a second. That's not right. I'm not the President of Bulgaria. I am the President of the Great Kingdom of Luxembourg.
Now hold on, I know I'm the President of something…
Yes! Thank you. I am the President of the United States of America. Now, who has a question?
Yes, ma'am.
My favorite part about being President?
I'm doing it right now. [kisses the girl on the forehead] Who's next? All right.
[to kids] Wait. Hang on a second.
Okay. [to the kids] Apparently, there's a group of kids in the other room that I might like better.
Yeah.
Okay. Send some flowers. Then I'll call his parents.
Okay. [looks at Charlie once more, then returns to the group of waiting children] All right, now on with the questions. Now wait a minute, when you address me, please bear in mind that you are speaking to His Royal Majesty, The King of all England.
Oh, what was it again?
Yes.
No.
Leave me alone.
Josh, what are you doing right now?
Blow it off.
Seriously, take an hour and come with us.
Leave me alone.
Oh I sneak out every now and then.
Yes, couple of agents, an unmarked black suburban. They tell the manager, they clear the store, I'm in, I'm out. It's like nothing ever happened.
Did you know that there's an underground tunnel out of here?
I haven't been able to find it even though I search almost everyday.
To a place called Rare Books, you know what they sell?
Funny boy.
Tell her to leave me alone. Sheila!
This is a Christmas thing I'm doing Mandy; we don't have to make hay out of it.
[to Josh] Want to come?
It's Christmas, Josh! No reason we can't do both.
Let's go shopping!
Oooh! 'The Fables of Phaedrus,' 1886, first edition, red leather label, gilt lettering, engraved frontice. Phaedrus, you know, who was a slave, but later granted his freedom by Augustus, wrote his animal fables in iambic verse.
That's what I say.
So, you won't change your mind?
So you're gonna sit around in your hotel room by yourself?
Oh! So you're gonna work on Christmas? Good, that makes me feel better.
Come to Manchester, stay at the house.
I wasn't planning on doing that, but now that you suggest it.
Suit yourself.
Yeah?
I'm not worried about it Leo.
It'll be fine, these things can go away by themselves.
I don't want to talk about an exit strategy.
I really don't. It's gonna be fine.
Yeah?
All right. You know Zoey is starting Georgetown in two weeks, I was thinking about getting this for her. 'The Nature of Things. A Viviscalic Poem Translated from the Latin of Titus Lucrecius Carus.'
Yeah. Because it's got brown Moroccan spine labels.
All right, thanks. [to the shop keepers] Thank you all, Merry Christmas!
'Life of Epicurus', two volumes.
Hello everybody. Welcome to The White House. [sees a young boy and shakes his hand] Joey. Welcome to the White House.
[under breath] No.
Deal with it.
[spots Toby by the door, to Mandy] I'll be right back.
Merry Christmas, Nancy.
Hi.
How you doing?
Apparently I've arranged for an honor guard for somebody.
No, no, just tell me, is there anything else I've arranged for? We're still in NATO, right?
What's going on?
Toby, you're not responsible…
Toby, if we start pulling strings like this, you don't think every homeless veteran would come out of the woodworks?
[beat] When is this thing?
Okay.
