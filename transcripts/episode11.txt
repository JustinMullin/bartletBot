Keep your seats. [beat, they all sit] Admiral Fitzwallace?
Is it clear what India's objective is?
When you say 'the Indian army,' what are we talking about?
Five guys in a Humvee? What?
[looking up] In the last twenty-five minutes?
300,000 is an awfully large piece of troop movement to have been on a whim.
This was long planned.
All I'm trying to do right now? I'm trying to avoid making eye contact with the CIA Director.
300,000 troops? I can't move my motorcade from K Street to Connecticut without it showing up on a weather satellite.
Pick it up again, would you please?
Any chance this is an exercise?
A threat gesture?
Any nuclear activity?
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, that's probably not important information.
All right. I'm ordering the Crisis Task Force activated, and I want you to prepare to give me a national security briefing. Thank you.
I've already had words. TOBY, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in an emergency session to try to affect a cease-fire.
We were getting to it.
They didn't exactly miss them. In fact, they've got a very good photo now.
Yeah.
Toby, how much do you know about India and Pakistan?
Hello.
Thanks, C.J.
Bobby?
Well, we've got ourselves a ballgame.
3:00.
Okay. Thank you.
Like what?
Well, bring in Dr. Strangelove and we're all set.
There's an India expert I want to bring in.
You guys are gonna love him.
He's colorful.
Lord John Marbury, former ambassador to New Delhi from the Court of Saint James.
He's colorful, Leo.
We can hide the women. But the man deserves a drink.
Let's get him on a plane.
Anything else?
Yeah.
This ought to be delightful.
Thanks for staying late, Charlie.
Sure.
I'm sorry?
My daughter asked you out?
I should have locked her in the dungeon.
I could have built one.
Charlie, you have picked the absolute worst time in the world to talk to me about this.
Okay.
Yes. [to Leo] He wants to go out with Zoey.
Shut up!
Mr. Ambassador.
Thank you for seeing us so late, and on such short notice.
Please sit down.
Mr. Ambassador, it is crucial that we join together to bring about a cease-fire and then a pullback, in Kashmir, before this conflict takes another escalating step.
You do.
Thank you.
Well, this just keeps getting better and better.
Mr. Ambassador.
You know Leo McGarry?
Please, sit down. We've been trying to phone your Prime Minister without any luck. Can you help us out there?
Mr. Ambassador, I stood at a podium this morning, and I publicly condemned the incursion by Indian forces.
My condemnation might have been stronger if my State Department didn't feel that the Indian action was provoked.
You deny there has been Pakistani movement in the Neutral Zone?
Hang on. Look. The U.S. is committed to finding a reasonable solution to the dispute.
Whatever the language, I know that you will agree with me that we have to find a way for these two countries to exist together in a global community.
I'd imagine the Indian ambassador is going to say roughly the same thing about you.
Yes. [standing] Thank you for coming.
[shaking hands with aides as they leave] Thank you.
I'll take the Indian ambassador in the Oval Office.
And then if you could just ask the Secret Service to step in and kill me, please.
Zoey just walked right up to him and asked him out.
See, but a dungeon would have put an end to that.
I think you're trying to cover up the fact that you're enjoying this.
I'm a father in pain.
Leo.
A racial problem?
I don't!
I don't have a racial problem.
I'm Spencer Tracy at the end of 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'
Racial problem!
My problem is not that she's white, he's black, it's that she's a girl and he's not. To say nothing of he's older than she is.
Yeah, but a guy learns a lot in those two years.
Tracy was good in that movie.
Thank you.
Mr. Ambassador.
I was looking a lot better before your country breached about fourteen cease-fire conditions without so much as a phone call, so let's sit down and talk. Charlie, please close the door.
My frustration, Mr. Ambassador, is that both you and the Pakistanis have nuclear weapons and a tendency to get cranky.
Well, it was nice spending this time with you.
Thank you.
Every time he talks about colonial Western imperialism, I always want to remind him that the United States is also a revolutionary country that threw off its colonial masters.
I keep forgetting.
Is he here?
Send him in please.
John!
Thank you for coming. How was your flight?
We need your take on the situation, John.
The world is coming apart at the seams.
Yeah, go ahead.
I want to ask him to stay a little bit and help us out.
You two are going to become good friends.
For the first couple of weeks, so did I.
Hello, Margaret.
Yeah.
Is he still on the phone?
Okay.
[going to his desk] There's a quote from Revelations I'm trying to remember.
It's about a horse.
Why not?
Say, listen. My hesitation about your going out with Zoey before, you know, it's not 'cause you're black.
It's not.
It is.
Still, I want you to go out with her if that's what you both want to do.
That's fine.
Just remember these two things: She's nineteen years old, and the 82nd Airborne works for me.
Also this - no kidding. You go out with Zoey, you're gonna get your picture taken. There's gonna be a lot of people not wild about the sight of you and the President's daughter. You know what to do with the mail, right?
[standing] All right. You keep your head up.
Should have built a dungeon.
[now searching for something in his desk drawer] Revelations. It's about a horse, and Death was riding on it maybe.
Okay.
Yes, please.
Thank you, Charlie.
Ah, good, I want you all to meet John.
Lord Marbury.
How you doing?
Don't you ever forget the battles you've fought and won.
That's what I'd heard. But all they got was two weeks.
John, I was hoping you'd stick around for a couple of days and help us out.
John, there's a quote from Revelationsâ€¦
Are you frightened, John?
Yes.
Good.
