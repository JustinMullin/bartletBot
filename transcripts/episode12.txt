With nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest home ownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957. [beat] I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of 290 million dollars just ten years ago…
What?
What'd I say?
I said million?
[clears throat] From a deficit of 290 billion dollars, just ten… it says 'million' on the TelePrompTer, by the way.
L-Let's take it back.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President…
…And how do we make the American dream of opportunity a reality for all? I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago, and I see we're spelling 'hallowed' with a pound sign in the middle of it.
The pound sign's silent?
I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago on a mission: to restore the American dream for all our people, as we gaze at the vast horizon of possibilities open to us in the 321st century… Wow, that was ambitious of me, wasn't it?
We meant 'stronger' here, right?
I'm proud to report our country's stranger than it was a year ago?
Could go either way.
Yes, sir.
Why is everyone asking me that today?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm taking many things, C.J.
I don't know. My wife hands me pills. I swallow them with water.
Vitamin C. Vitamin B. Is it possible I'm taking something called 'euthanasia'?
Ah, that sounds more like it… Toby?
I'm taking pills, C.J.
[beat] You know, carrying them around in my pocket was a pretty big step for me.
Toby?
'How do we make the American dream a reality for all who work for it.'
You got to add, 'who work for it.'
It's what they're listening for in welfare reforms, so screw it.
Damn, Toby, 'cause you're exactly who I was gonna come running to.
Well, I'm gazing in the 321st century, man. There's a lot on my mind.
Oh, dear God. I will take the pills, C.J.
Yes. I will go to the Oval Office, and pour a glass of water from the Steuben glass pitcher, which was a gift from the Christian Charity Network there, Skippy.
I'm just saying, before you start calling me, Ebenezer Bartlet, remember, I got a really nice glass pitcher for just, you know, being a good guy.
[waves the bag of pills in the air] I will take the pills.
I don't need a cardiogram.
I got dizzy.
I didn't have a heart attack, Leo. I got the flu, and I don't need a cardiogram.
Leo, I'm fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham… Mrs. Landingham how do I look to you?
[to Leo] See?
Can't yet.
Situation Room. [gives Leo the note, which he reads]
Just a little joke.
101.9 and I still got it.
Anybody know if the Celtics won tonight?
It was a two-week cease-fire. There's four days left.
What's Intel saying about the Pakistanis?
They've got mine.
I'm going to bed. But somebody call me if there's movement.
Yeah?
Ugh. Good night.
[into phone] It tested very well. I'm not saying we're doing it, Toby. I just want to try it and see how it reads. The era of big government is over… All right. Thanks.
I'm feeling roughly the same as I was feeling when you asked me four minutes ago.
It's okay. This isn't the worst of it, Charlie. The worst of it's coming up the stairs right now.
Hello.
Abbey?
I was wondering when you were gonna notice me.
No.
You're very sexy when you're in doctor mode you know that? Give me an IV/saline solution and 100 milligrams of Flumadine. Stat. [beat] I could jump you right now.
My thing's more fun.
Fitzwallace called me in the Situation Room. There was more movement in Kashmir.
Abbey?
I broke the Steuben glass pitcher in the Oval Office.
Seriously, Abbey, I'm fine.
[groans] But I didn't.
Yeah.
I really don't remember.
Fitzwallace says the Pakistanis are giving command control to some nuclear weapons to the field.
I'm really sorry about the pitcher.
I could jump you right now.
Can I go to the office?
Why not?
Why?
Here's the thing though. I never really saw you study while you were in med school.
Do you even know what you're listening for right now? [inhales]
[exhales] How many?
I'm going to the office.
Really?
Okay.
Uh-oh.
Alright. I think I'll stay here for a little bit.
I don't understand. Don't any of these characters have jobs?
They seem to have a lot of free time in the middle of the day.
And that woman's changed her clothes for quite a lot in one afternoon.
Yeah. Would you mind stepping out, Charlie?
Abbey phoned me up and told me about your conversation. I was diagnosed about seven years ago. My life expectancy is normal. My particular course of MS is relapsing-remitting, which means I should experience total recovery after attacks. Abbey gives me injections of something called Betaseron, and that reduces the frequency. Fever and stress tend to be two things that induces attacks.
101.9.
You haven't called me 'Jed' since I was elected.
'Cause I wanted to be the President.
You've been a friend.
I know.
When you stood up there today, I was so proud. I wanted to be with you.
I tried to get up, but I fell back down again.
[fights back tears] I'm so sorry, Leo. I really am.
Yeah, Charlie?
Yeah, give us a minute, would you please?
And a strong shot of whiskey?
What have you got for me, John?
Buy them?
How?
John, please.
What does India want?
Your friend, the prime minister?
He's gonna go for this?
All right, you tell the ambassador we'll discuss this in three months. In three months, John. I don't want this to be like quid pro quo.
That's the carrot. Leo, what's the stick?
They put command-control in the field, John, and we're gonna get physical. You make damn sure they know that.
Talk to the ambassador. I want Fitzwallace to have photos in 24 hours.
Yes, Charlie?
Toby, come in please.
Let's hope.
Much better. Thank you.
You know, I was watching a television program before with a sort of a roving moderator who spoke to a seated panel of young women who are having some sort of problems with their boyfriends. Apparently, because the boyfriends have all slept with the girlfriend's mothers. Then they brought all the boyfriends out and they fought right there on television. Toby, tell me, these people don't vote, do they?
What do you need, Josh?
[sits] What's on your mind?
You want to cut the line?
I think so, too. [beat] What do you think, Josh?
Then you and Sam get your people together and get to work.
Thank you.
Abbey…?
You've taken it 14 times in the last three hours. You're not taking it again.
At least not with a thermometer.
I'm saying if you want to take it recreationally…
Yes, I do.
I stopped asking those questions.
Good evening.
Thank you, John.
Godspeed, your Lordship.
Friends, let me have your attention please. A lot of time, energy, passion, wit, skill, and talent went into drafting this, and while you might not know it from my delivery later, this is an extraordinary speech. And I say thee yea! Toby Ziegler, and I say thee yea! Sam Seaborn!
Roger.
Roger, I'm sorry you drew the short straw on this. We'll miss you tonight. Next year, it'll be the surgeon general, I promise. Meanwhile, you can watch TV at my study.
Oh, thank you.
What is it?
This is magnificent.
[reads] 'He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information on the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'
Thank you, Roger.
Oh, Roger, if anything happened, you know what to do, right?
First thing always is national security. Get your commanders together. Appoint joint chiefs. Appoint chairman. Take them to Defcon 4. Have the governor send emergency delegates to Washington. The assistant attorney general is gonna be the acting A.G. If he tells you he wants to bring out the National Guard, do what he tells you.
You have a best friend?
Is he smarter than you?
Would you trust him with your life?
That's your chief of staff.
Oh, in the residence, in the second floor, the bathroom at the end of the hall. You have to jiggle the handle a little.
I got to go. [beat] You'll do fine. People have phenomenal capacity.
