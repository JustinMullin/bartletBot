I don't want to spend the whole day talking about bananas. Good morning Nancy, good morning Mrs. Landingham.
No.
I really don't want a banana.
Yes, thank you.
I'm done talking to you now.
Good Morning everyone. Sit down, sit down please.
Are we a poor Latin American country?
Then why am I having this conversation?
I'm in trouble with Chiquita and Dole?
Toby.
We have appointed five people to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans in the House, as well as an alarming number of Democrats, have been holding up those appointments.
As far as I can tell, their reluctance has little, if anything, to do with bananas.
You're all set?
You're going to sit with them?
And talk to the father.
The mother too, but I'm concerned about the father.
This is no time to out a guy in front and center who's embarrassed that his son was gay.
Sit and talk to them.
I haven't had chance yet.
Give me a chance to look it over and we'll talk at the end of the day.
Josh and Sam, wait up a second. Leo, don't go away. [follows Josh and Sam into the hallway] [to the agent outside] Excuse us a second. Thank you.
[to Josh and Sam] What time are you going up to the Hill?
I want to pre-empt a hearing. I don't want it. I don't want it for Leo. I don't want it for his family. I don't want it for us. They know that, and they're gonna play "Let's Make a Deal." Don't take anything off the table until you've talked to me. You understand?
Okay. Unless a war breaks out, I'll be spending much of my day talking about bananas.
Thank you.
Alright. [goes back into the office to join Leo] Is Simon Blye coming in to meet with you today?
I broke into your secret schedule compartment and took infrared photos with my compact camera. [sits]
Margaret told me. Look, why are you meeting with that man?
No, he's not.
In good times, Leo. It's not hard to like a guy when he's doing well. The measure of a man is, how does he behave when things are otherwise?
That you couldn't get from me? Or Toby, or Josh, or Sam, or C.J.?
I know you…
You put a lot of faith in people, Leo, and I love you for that. I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
Especially now.
Okay.
I will.
Thank you.
"By the age of 14, more than 25 percent have touched a girl's…" I won't say that word. [he scribbles on the report then reads silently.] Not going to say that. [scribbles]
[reading silently] Not going to say that. [scribbles]
Yes?
Go.
Thank you.
With you?
No.
Because I'd rather not be in therapy for the rest of my life.
[reading silently] I won't say that word. [scribbles]
Mrs. Landingham.
You're not going to believe this but I think I'd actually like a banana.
Why not?
I wasn't snippy!
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham.
She withholds food from me.
The sex-ed report.
We're gonna leave it alone for a while.
[busy at his desk] After the midterm elections.
Yeah.
It's a pretty incendiary report.
[crosses out to stand in front of her] It's not gonna play well at a PTA meeting, C.J. It says we should be teaching kids to have sex.
Of course it doesn't. But that's how it's going to play.
[in a somewhat patronizing tone] C.J.
C.J., getting it through this congress, a body which at the moment, will only give federal funding to sex education programs that teach abstinence only.
[raising his voice] And we will avail ourselves of that pulpit but we will do it after the midterm elections.
I needed to get Leo off the hook, C.J.
Yes. We'll deal with it after the midterm elections.
[back behind his desk] I was hoping you would.
Yeah. Well there's nothing wrong with telling them we got it. I wouldn't make a big deal out of it. We got it, we're looking at it, we're studying it. Throw it out with the trash.
Thanks, C.J.
I know.
