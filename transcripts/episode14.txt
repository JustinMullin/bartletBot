C.J., look…
I was helping pass the time. I was being entertaining as well as instructive.
Leo! What're you doing here?
Great!
Aww. You don't know how to have fun when we're traveling…
We got to get Mendoza on the bench.
Why is it my problem at all?
The governor of Michigan.
Yeah.
Which allows for the death penalty in certain drug related homicides.
How long?
Okay, I'll wait for that then.
I'm gonna want to see our people over the next few days.
I'm not going to be very good at this, Leo.
Yeah. [calls] Charlie!
Thank you.
Charlie, there's a priest in Hanover. His name is Thomas Cavanaugh. He's at the Immaculate Heart of Mary. I'd like to arrange to have him come down and spend some time with me this weekend. Very important that the White House not pay for this. This is my nickel.
And I'm gonna want to… [stops]
No. No, never mind. [pause] Yeah. I'm gonna want to talk to the Pope.
Charlie.
[gets up and walks over to Charlie] I'm gonna ask you a question. And this is one of those times that it's okay to tell me I've stepped over the line, and I should shut my mouth, okay.
What happened to the guy who shot your mother?
If they did, would you wanna see him executed?
Killing a police officer's a capital crime. I figured you must have thought about it.
And?
[looks thoughtful] Yeah.
Thank you, Charlie.
[walks up] Hey, Josh.
How are you?
Who are your friends?
[to Joey] How are you?
Thank you.
Hi, Kenny.
I was just wandering the halls and thinking.
[to Joey] You ever seen the White House?
Let's take a walk.
Come on.
Do you read lips?
Joey?
Is that short for Joanne?
And your last name is Lucas?
Is that Polish?
Protestant?
Well, this is the Oval Office. Come in, please. Sit down.
Well, where did you go to school?
There's a guy named Simon Cruz on death row. He's going to be executed in about 36 hours. What do you think I should do?
Why?
He was found guilty of a double murder and drug trafficking.
You're against capital punishment.
Did you study St. Augustine at Stanford?
Thomas Aquinas?
Two pretty smart guys, right?
They believed in that part of the Old Testament which said, 'Who sheddeth a man's blood by man shall his blood be shed.'
I've got a Harris poll says seventy-one percent of the American people support capital punishment.
I'm a politician.
In the California forty-sixth?
O'Dwyer's an empty shirt.
I don't like guys who run for congress because they think it's a great gig. Find yourself a live one and I'll get interested. In the meantime, the devil you know beats the devil you don't. And I like the devil I got.
Josh will take care of you from here.
Okay.
Thank you.
Fine. What do you need?
Jewish law doesn't prohibit…
The commandment does not say, 'Thou shalt not kill.' It says, 'Thou shalt not murder.'
We make it very hard to kill anybody in this country, Toby.
But it's not.
Hey.
Toby went to Shul.
Yeah.
I commute this guy, for no particular reason other than I don't like the death penalty…
And the next President sees it in a different way. I've laid track to all kinds of… The next guy is gonna have eighth amendment problems up the ass.
We cannot execute some people and not execute others depending on the mood of the Oval Office. It's cruel and unusual.
Okay. Give me a minute please, Nancy. [looks at Leo and shakes his head]
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Tom.
Thank you, Charlie.
Thanks for coming all this way down.
Yeah, it seems like a wasted trip.
This is it.
You're looking at the room.
We don't use the red phone anymore.
I tell Mrs. Landingham I want to talk to the Kremlin. Would you like a drink?
To be honest, I prefer Mr. President.
You understand why, right?
It's not ego.
There are certain decisions I have to make while I'm in this room. Do I send troops into harm's way? Which fatal disease gets the most research money?
It's helpful in those situations not to think of yourself as the man but as the office.
I want you to know that I had a number of people on my staff search for a reason the public would find palatable to commute the sentence. A technicality. Any evidence of racism.
Yeah.
I'm the leader of a democracy, Tom. Seventy-one percent of the people support capital punishment. People have spoken. The courts have spoken.
Yeah.
[upset] Oh, for crying out loud, Tom. I open my mouth and say, 'Somebody get me the Pope.'
Anyway. I looked for a way out, I really did.
I know.
I know.
I did, Tom. I know it's hard to believe, but I prayed for wisdom.
[shakes his head] It never has. And I'm a little pissed off about that.
[dead serious] I'm not kidding.
Yes, please.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned…
