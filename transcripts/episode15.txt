'If the shoe fits!'
[reading] 'When reporters confronted Secretary O'Leary in a hallway outside the hearing room, she defendedâ€¦' Oh come on!
Leo!
Yeah. [to staff] Let's go. [They all head out of the Oval Office.] 'If the shoe fits.' Is that the best she could do?
Let me say that I have great confidence in Deborah O'Leary. She's done a terrific job at HUD, helping thousands of people make the very difficult transition from joblessness and homelessness to more fulfilling and productive lives.
I was hoping you weren't going to notice that, Danny.
Then I will tell you that I agree the Republican Party does not have a comprehensive program for combating poverty in this country. That being said, there are countless Republicans who are working very hard to change their party's legacy on some of these issues. And I hope to be working with them to do just that.
Frankly, I think she went too far in assigning motive to Congressman Wooden and the Republican Party.
She'll be meeting with Leo McGarry.
An apology'd be appropriate.
[to reporters] Thank you everyone. [gets up and they head back towards the Oval Office] That went pretty well.
What?
What could you possibly want right now?
In the morning?
I mean, what in the name of everything holy could you want right now?
Who the hell is this?
And what could you possibly want?
All right.
I'll get up now. [hangs up the phone with difficulty]
[wakes up and quickly grabs Charlie's wrist] Charlie, are you aware you're committing a federal crime right now?
How did you know the First Lady wasn't going to be naked when you came in here? [looks at her empty side of the bed] Come to think of it, where the hell is my wife?
That's right.
[finally gets up] Have you slept yet?
Good.
I'm tired, I'm cranky, and my wife's in Argentina. Let's get this over with.
What?
What kind of incidents?
Who did?
Oh God.
I have a secret plan to fight inflation?
Why am I gonna be reading that I do?
By who?
You told the press I have a secret plan to fight inflation?
Josh, I'm a little confused.
Okay, before we go on. C.J., if blood is gushing from the head wound you just received from a stampeding herd of bison, you'll do the press briefing.
A secret plan to fight inflation?
Were you clear?
Are you telling me that not only did you invent a secret plan to fight inflation, but now you don't support it?
What did Mendoza do?
I didn't, he did. [points at Leo]
You said you were gonna fix it.
It's broken again, Leo.
We will have the first of what I think will a series of discussions about professionalism another time, Toby. Where is Mendoza?
Right now?
Day after tomorrow?
Is he coming in from Neptune?
Okay. We will wait for Mendoza. In the meantime, C.J., you will untangle the Press Corps.
And we will hope that nothing happens today to make this any worse. Although I certainly wouldn't bet the house on it. That is all.
Good.
Get out.
