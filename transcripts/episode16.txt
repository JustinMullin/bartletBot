I don't like putting him in this position.
I just don't want you to think that I'm getting any pleasure in putting him in this position.
It's ironic.
I mean it's ironic that it all comes down to a vote on the ethanol tax credit.
50-50 tie.
Are you being brusque with me?
I'm just saying you can't blame me. It's what you get from having an even number of senators.
That's what I usually do.
[to Ron in front] Ron, am I going to meet her on the plane?
[to Leo] Zoey got a new agent on her detail.
Have you seen these new agents?
They've got the hair, the backpacks, the clothes. Walking around campus strapped to a 44 magnum.
Let me tell you something, when it's your kid, you don't want them blending in. You want them wearing a sign that says, "I'm carrying a loaded gun, and the safety's off."
No.
Leo.
I won't get tired.
I want to come home after the fundraiser.
It'll be fine.
Your impersonation of my mother is getting sharper and sharper, you know that?
I'll see you tomorrow.
C.J.! Charlie! My flying companions!
Is everybody on board?
Press in a good mood?
Why not?
Oh, it's going to be great. We're going to race the sun to the pacific horizon!
Morning, Everyone. Sam, it's going to be 50-50 on the ethanol tax credit.
Make all the calls you want, it's going to be 50-50.
You two are so freaked out about this Al Kiefer meeting.
We'll listen to him, Josh.
You two want to see the best part about having my job? [into the Intercom] Colonel, this is the president. I'm ready to go.
[shaking her hand] How do you do?
Thank you, Ron.
[to Gina] I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to meet before now. You've been with Zoey's detail, what?
You were in the army?
How did you get there?
Where?
You were a Mountaineer.
With a degree in?
So, you were commissioned a second lieutenant?
How old are you?
How long have you trained for this assignment?
What, were you the first one to sign up?
All right.
You know Zoey's dating my body man, Charlie Young, right?
You know about the letters?
Are they white supremacists?
You don't have an artist's sketch, or psychological profiles, or anything?
It is.
Okay. Zoey's 19 and she wants to be a teenager. She wants a college experience, and I can't blame her. I loved college. So did my other daughters. I want Zoey to be comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the slip. It's not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to tell me if she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's doing with her friends. You know what your job is.
Thank you.
Gina?
If she's cutting English Lit, I want to know about it.
Okay.
I'm sorry. I've actually been told that I have to go now. This is a debate that is obviously going to continue in town halls, city halls, state legislatures, and the U.S. House of Representatives. There is a population in this country that seems to focus so much time and energy into this conversation, so much so that I am forced to ask this question -- is there an epidemic of flag burning going on that I'm not aware of?
I mean it, man, is there an emergency-level outbreak of flag desecration no one's kept me posted on?
Toby, there is no reason for you to feel threatened by Al Kiefer.
Excellent. Because we're doing it over lunch.
Back at the Hotel.
Better, yet, Charlie, where is Zoey having lunch?
Why?
That supposed to be a good place, Sam?
Is that an L.A. experience?
Well, there aren't going to be any people today.
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
Yeah, but the hotel wouldn't make the guacamole right in front of me.
We can do it in the car. Who's talking to Leo?
You come in the car, too.
[looks at a group across the street] Those people over there don't like me too much.
You would honestly think there was an epidemic of flag burning going on, endangering countless lives in this country.
I'm having lunch with my daughter, Toby. You guys are going to sit with Kiefer, and let me know what's worth listening to.
[to Toby] We'll see you there.
No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole.
I could tell you were thinking it.
Good.
Surprised you for lunch, I know, I'm the best.
You are.
Yeah, but on the other hand, the guy made guacamole right in front of us.
This is father/daughter fun time.
Oh, you know, I hadn't thought about that. [looks around] Now that you mention it, yeah, I think you're right.
All kinds of things in California, Zoey. You've got your smog, your freeway shootings, brush fires, mudslides. Plus, apparently, there's a mad rash of flag burning going on, and you don't want a piece of that.
Right there, right in front of me, they made the guacamole. Now, how about that?
C.J., has Al said something that I should listen to, yet?
What do you got?
What do you got, Al?
Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing them, you know. Especially in front of my daughter.
Yeah, Charlie. [to the others] We'll talk about this later. [tightens his tie and gets up]
Yeah.
Men with pools and patios think I'm weak.
Was that Marcus on the phone?
No way I can get out of it?
I used to like parties, you know that?
We're running out of reasons not to fire him, Leo.
I can ask for his resignation, and don't be a smart ass.
What?
About what?
Sam's weighing in.
All right, let's do what Sam said.
I'm not done with Hoynes, but dump it.
I'll call him from the plane. [hangs up] Christ, will this damn day never end?
It's not going to pass, Ted. It's not going to get voted on.
And I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol, you make that public demand, Ted, and you're going to be Cameron's best friend.
Oh, God, Ted! Give me the name of one person who's complaining to you, and I'll call them personally and tell them I will never sign a law like that.
Ted.
[yells] Because I know what I'm doing, Ted! Because I live in the world of professional politics, and you live in the world of adolescent tantrum! [beat] Don't you ever slap Josh Lyman around again. That guy is the White House Deputy Chief of Staff. He's not one of your associate producers.
Don't screw around with me now, Ted. I'm really not in the mood.
Right now, right this second, the worst thing that could possibly happen to gay rights in this country is for me to put that thing on the debating table, which is happens the minute I open my mouth. Do you get that? I'm a human starting gun, Ted. You got to trust me! I know what I'm doing.
Do you?
Thank you.
No.
Imagine how tired I'm going to look when you see me a couple of months from now. [beat] I haven't slept well, lately. Kept everyone up on the plane as we flew out. You know, we left at 3 in the morning? I really want to try to sleep on the way back.
[into phone] Anyway, Mr. Vice President, it's taken care of, we can put it to rest.
You're welcome. Bye.
Wait. John?
I want to tell you, a couple of years ago in Iowa, I really admired the way you hung in there on the ethanol tax credit. You went out to Iowa and said the same things you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it wasn't going to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only one to say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa and who knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today, John.
I'm going to try to go to sleep now.
Yeah.
