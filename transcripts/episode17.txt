[reading] Is here going to be a coup?
Is there going to be a coup?
And this is on page….
Page 17.
Yeah? [looks up] Oh. [to advisors] Excuse me, please. [gets up and walks over to Leo] Leo… Intelligence briefing.
There are mornings I'm just nodding my head. That can't be good for anybody.
No!
[shocked] He died?!?
I'll say. Who knows so far?
Dammit.
[looks at his watch] The market is going to open 200 points down.
When was the last time we were lucky?
It's going to be 300…350.
Not yet.
Not… yet.
I'm not saying I'm not sure it's Ehrlich.
I'm saying I'm not sure. It's the Fed Chairman. Give me a day.
How expensive.
Wall Street needs to trust me.
A day. I'll tell you something else. You could have been nicer to me during this conversation.
By saying that Wall Street does trust me and the market will hold until I appoint a new Fed Chairman.
I'm taking the day.
No.
I'm not ready to jump into bed with Ron Ehrlich yet. I'm one of the few people in my family who can say that.
So… [sits] That's was page 17?
Without regard to the validity of past arguments.
Yes and I'm saying that condition doesn't exist anymore.
Historically, American prosperity has been built the broad growth in the GDP of 5% of greater. And now with the deflationary pressures of the Global Economy, that kind of growth can be achieved without the negative side affects of rampant inflation. [to C.J.] Do you understand what I'm saying?
My point is Ron Ehrlich might not be the guy. I'm saying it's not a mortal lock.
[shakes head] No…
No, no…
[shakes head] Noooo…
C.J., we don't handle my wife. When we try, do you know what happens at the other end of this building? [smiles]
I get a little punishment. Screw it. Let's move on. It's not a big deal. [walks behind his desk]
[to C.J.] But try to find out who those friends of my wife's are in the wire piece and take them out back and have them shot. [to Leo] Can I do that?
Yeah, Leo says I can do that. It's gonna be Phyllis who has never liked me. It's gonna be Susan who thinks I'm xenophobic because I don't like Mexican food. These are my wife's friends.
Yes. [to Leo and C.J.] It could be our old next-door neighbors Herb and Marjorie Douglas. [Mrs. Landingham frowns at him.] They're still angry at me 'cause I accidentally ran them over with my car.
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham.
No.
Thank you, C.J.
I'll tell you what else; historically 2 to 2 Ohm GDP expansion is classified lack luster even anemic economic growth. [walks towards the open door] Four Ohm to 5% is needed just to be considered robust and not even spectacular.
Sometimes I'm just making it up.
Hello, sweetheart.
[kisses Zoey on the cheek.] You used to go to school in overalls with a little hat. [closes the door]
Who the hell knows? [gives her a hug]
No.
Thank you, Leo.
What you got today?
How about math. Why aren't you taking math?
Wiseass all you want, but you're coming of age in the 21st century. A century in which I promise you mathematics is going to play a starring role. On the other hand I would definitely put my shoulder into Intro to Cinema. Intro to Cinema's what got me where I am today.
That was going to be a big part of my day. [gives her the books back]
I met with Butterfield and some Secret Service Agents this morning.
You didn't do anything. They think you should be taking more math.
It's time for me to tell you about some letters we've been getting.
[frowns] Yeah. They don't like that the daughter of the President is dating a young black man.
Zoey, please don't tell me you're dating more than one guy.
Ok.
Cause one guy for you is actually one more than I'm comfortable with.
I could see it's had a real impact on you.
No worse than any of the stuff they intercept.
Yeah. Why did Butterfield and the guys meet with me? Apparently there's National Convention of some sort in Virginia. It was in the papers yesterday that you and Charlie are going to some club opening this weekend.
You don't have to cancel, but you can't bring Charlie.
You want me to tell him?
You gotta tell him he truth Zoey. Don't make something up.
You sure you don't want me to come?
Okay.
Yeah?
Okay. [to Zoey] You gotta go.
I never really new him that well.
I don't know. You want the job?
Can't have it. Know why?
Not enough math. Bye.
Danny…
Please. [motions to the couch]
Yes.
[smiles] We note with surprise your lack of conviction, Leo.
I miss our late night talks, Danny.
[smiles warmly] Out there in the campaign trail…. Ames, Iowa…Tulsa… Skokie, Center City, Tallahassee, Albany…San Antonio, Jasper, Wyoming.
[nods and smiles] We got very close.
You covered the First Lady as well.
You literally wrote the book on my wife.
Once again I want to emphasize the strong personal bond we built on the campaign…
[shifts uncomfortably] Well, I was… going to… [looks at Leo] …in a… proper… gentlemanly…
…way… [glares at Leo]
Danny.
You must save me from having this conversation with my wife.
Or at least make it seem like I'm better armed than I evidently am.
[scowls] Danny…
We're off the record.
Welcome to the club, Danny. We had some jackets made.
[sighs and smiles] Albany…Tulsa, Wichita. [laughs] I'm not kidding…a personal bond here, Danny.
[nervously] You're coaching my Personal Aide on how to best score with my daughter? Yes, Danny, that does make me feel better.
Go away.
The rhythm of the sewing machine petals?
Stay.
Chicken.
Hello.
Abbey?
[nervously] Listen… [quickly walks to the door and closes it]
Well, your Chief of Staff is a very attractive woman. Maybe he was, you know…
Abbey, I told C.J. specifically…
[contrite] No, she didn't.
She didn't get the signal wrong. I wanted her to send someone.
This wire thing is a problem for me. The kid on TV was a mistake. And the amendment, from Becky Reeseman…
…will bring down a trade bill that's been worked on for years.
[nods] Fine.
I staffed it out to C.J..
That's right.
[yells, bangs on the desk] Then don't play me, Abbey! Don't work me! A lot of people around here think it was Lilly Mays, who planted you have a preference for Ron Erlich!
[loudly] I know it wasn't Lilly Mays. It was you!
[angry] Yes!
[angry] Well you put me in a bit of a spot there, Abigail. I name Ron Erlich now, which I was going to do anyway, and it makes me look like I'm taking instructions from my wife!
Are you talking about you or me?
[sternly] I'm talking about sending me messages through the press, and staking out agendas on morning shows. We are not going to be these people, Abbey. I'm not gonna do it! [loudly] I'll walk up to the hill right now, and I will give the Speaker of the House my resignation.
[yelling] Do you want to see me get on the phone and put it in session?!
[yelling] It was nine months, Abbey. Not six months. And I waited a day on Skippy, because the fed chair is a fairly important position, and I wanted to make damn sure my decision was right.
How the hell do you know?
Yes.
Yes.
On that point I concede the high ground.
Good.
No, no however. Just be wrong. Just stand there in your wrongness and be wrong, and get used to it.
Nine months, Abbey.
Yes?
Abbey, please.
[looks thoughtful and nods] Yeah.
Okay. [pause] We just had our first Oval Office fight.
Did you talk to Zoey today? [leans next to her, avoiding her gaze]
Maybe she'll be so traumatized by this experience, that she'll never date another boy again.
Don't finish that sentence, I'm a man of questionable health. [glances at her sideways] The Michigan women are waiting for me.
