Charlie.
I heard. It's the first time anyone's canceled lunch on me since I took office.
I'm not saying he didn't have a good excuse.
Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation by George Washington.
The rules were drawn from an English translation of a French book of maxims. Washington copied them down when he was 14 years old. [reads] "When you sit down, keep your feet firm and even, without putting one on the other or crossing them. Put not off your clothes in the presence of others, nor go out of your chamber half-dressed." What a tightassed little priss he must've been.
[takes off her glasses and regards Charlie] Do you think I could take George Washington?
I don't know… a war?
Yeah.
The Minutemen were good.
Yeah. [winks and puts his glasses back on to read]
You can send her in.
C.J.
[reads] "When in company, put not your hands on any part of your body not usually covered."
Yeah, you're right. What's going on?
What is going on?
What are you talking about?
Why did she lie?
Then why did she?
She never has to.
Apparently she doesn't.
[gets riled] A reporter talked to her on campus?
C.J.!
[starts to put on his shoes] Put the press in the briefing room. Tell them I'm coming right over.
C.J….
We have been over this and we have been over this and we have been over this! They are not supposed to talk to my daughter on campus.
I don't give a damn if it was the Bergen County Shopper's Guide. I want to talk to the press.
Watch me.
So I just sit in my office and fume?
Fine.
What?
Excellent.
I haven't heard anything about it.
I could take George Washington, by the way.
Anything else?
Thank you, C.J.
