Can we get this Godforsaken event over with so I can get back to presiding over a civilization gone to hell in a handcart?
Leave me alone.
What what is?
There's nothing wrong with my mood.
Would you get off me with that?
I know I'd like to beat you senseless with a head of cabbage. I know that for damn sure.
Charlie, does anyone have my remarks?
Is Toby on his way?
C.J.?
Why aren't they here right now?
Nothing like surrounding yourself with the best and the brightest, Charlie.
Hello.
You didn't know it was raining?
Okay.
A couple of things, uh, who am I gonna be talking to now?
No, seriously now.
Give me the damn speech.
Have I ever been trout fishing?
Okay.
What's going on Josh?
Hang on.
Two F.E.C. commissioners resigned?
There are two seats open in the F.E.C.?
This is interesting.
Leo, two seats just opened up in the Federal Election Commission.
I'm saying, what if this time we say we want our guys?
Yeah, but we can dangle our feet in the water.
Josh-
I'm talking about dangling our feet in the water. Josh, get Leo two candidates who back aggressive campaign finance reform.
I'm not saying jump off the boat, Josh. I'm saying dangle our feet.
Yes. Somebody?
Thank you.
No, I'm definitely gonna be thinking about the trout fishermen, Leo, 'cause that's where my focus should be.
I was in a better mood a year ago, Leo.
C.J., are you taller than you usually are?
Couldn't pick a trout out of a police lineup, by the way.
Who's got this?
Why am I just finding out about this now?
I really did wake up energized this morning.
I never go to bed that way.
Just once, in this job, I'd like to end a day feeling as good as I did when the day started. [pause] Are you bothered by this?
Yeah.
We've heard it all before, Leo. You drive me to political safe ground. It's not true.
Good. [heads for his desk]
[turns] What the hell did you say?
Leo?
You're wrong.
You want to do this now?
You came to my house, Leo.
You came to my house, and you said, 'Jed, let's run for President.' I said, 'Why?' And you said, 'So that you can open your mouth and say what you think!' Where'd that part go, Leo?
Lookâ€¦
This morning-
Did I not say put our guys on the F.E.C.?
Leo!
You're writing a fascinating version of history, my friend.
You brought me in on teachers. You brought me in on capital gains. You brought me in on China. And you brought me in on guns.
That's crap.
Leo, if I ever told you to get aggressive about campaign finance or gays in the military, you would tell me, 'Don't run too fast or go to far.'
I have said it, and nothing's every happened!
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I don't want to go to sleep like this.
I want to speak.
This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
What's happening?
Yes!
This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
You have a strategy for all this?
What is it?
