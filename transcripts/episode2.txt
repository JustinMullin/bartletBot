That's no good. Jaworski knows that's no good.
Americans need to buy more American cars.
Good morning everyone.
What do you got?
I heard.
You're kidding.
The Ryder Cup team?
I know what the Ryder Cup team is. Thanks Mrs. Landingham.
[looks at his schedule] I've got an intelligence briefing, a security briefing, and a 90-minute budget meeting all scheduled for the same 45 minutes. You sure this is a good time to talk about my sense of humor?
Me neither.
I know.
I know.
It makes a difference.
I think I was there.
C.J., on your tombstone, it's gonna read, 'Post hoc, ergo propter hoc.'
Twenty-seven lawyers in the room, anybody know 'post hoc, ergo propter hoc?' Josh?
Thank you. Next?
Leo?
After it, therefore because of it. It means one thing follows the other, therefore it was caused by the other, but it's not always true. In fact, it's hardly ever true. We did not lose Texas because of the hat joke. Do you know when we lost Texas?
Go figure.
What's in Jordan?
You should stay here. We got Amman, a woman, little kids, the works.
See, that was a joke.
Everybody's a critic today.
So what's in Amman?
Good for you. How long are you gonna stay?
When do you leave?
What's my temperature?
Fahrenheit?
[chuckles] So how's the kid?
Can she spell anything yet?
Got any pictures?
Thank you, Nancy.
Oh, she's beautiful. What's her name?
That name's got a hell of a past.
Your wife's beautiful too. How'd you get her to marry you? Did you trick her or something?
Yeah, I figured. [beat] Morris, I made a joke about golfers yesterday, and now it consumes the whole damn building.
Jokes like that are part of my folksy charm, Morris. It's the very heart of my popularity.
Oh, we're having some difficulty getting the word out.
Oh, thank you. Is this from this morning, Carol?
[sighs] So how's my pulse?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[jokingly] Yeah, why not? Two Dewars on the rocks, Mrs. Landingham.
I had a meeting this morning with the Joint Chiefs. [beat] I'm an accomplished man, Morris. I can sit comfortably with prime ministers and Presidents, even the pope. Why is it every time I sit with the Joint Chiefs, I feel like I'm back at my father's dinner table.
You're a naval officer. You're a doctor in a uniform. [beat] It's not like I'm totally without experience, you know.
You're talking to a former governor. I was commander-in-chief of the New Hampshire National Guard.
Didn't have to. We'd just stand on the border and stare you down. Then we'd all go for pancakes. Like you had a lot of closed infantry combat training in premed, huh?
What is that?
I don't need a flu shot.
How do I know this isn't the start of a military coup?
I want the Secret Service in here right away.
Now that's a thought that's gonna fester.
Thank you. I'm not comfortable with violence. [beat] I know this country has enemies, but I don't feel violent toward any of them. I don't know whether that's a weakness or not, but I think I know how the Joint Chiefs would answer that question.
And the red meat.
Don't forget your picture. Corey's a beautiful child.
You didn't do nothing, mister. You were a passenger on this one. Your job is to pay the bills, and do what these ladies tell you to do.
Also, you got to teach her how to whistle. Her mother won't do that.
I'll see you next week, Morris.
Right. [Morris heads for the door.] Morris?
Look at that picture again. See? The past isn't the only thing your family can be proud of.
Go away.
I do, indeed. Mr. White, good to see you. Mr. Finley…
Mrs. Landingham?
I'm done, right?
All righty. Thank you. What's in the bag?
It's a shirt.
They left me a shirt?
I think they left me something else, Mrs. Landingham.
I think they left me 12 center-cut prime fillet Omaha Steaks, Mrs. Landingham.
I was going to have Mario fix me one of those steaks tonight.
You stole my steaks.
You are a cattle rustler, Mrs. Landingham.
Between you and Dr. Tolliver, who needs a wife or a mother?
What time is it?
Where is the Syrian ambassador?
Tel Aviv and London?
Alright, uh… [big sigh] I'm gonna call Morris' wife now. I'll meet you in the Situation Room.
Leo?
I am not frightened. I'm gonna blow them off the face of the earth with the fury of God's own thunder. [beat] Get the commanders.
