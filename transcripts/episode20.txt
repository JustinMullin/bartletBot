I get nervous around laws that fundamentally assume that Americans can't be trusted. We'd better have mandatory sentencing, because judges can't be trusted to disperse even-handed justice.
We better have term limits, 'cause voters can't be trusted to recognize corruption.
Oh, and by the way… I say, by the way. When the playing field is leveled and the process is fair and open, it turns out we have term limits. They're called elections.
My father was very fond of the analogy of the Irish lads whose journey was blocked by a brick wall, seemingly too high to scale. Throwing their caps over the wall, the lads had no choice but to follow. How many times in the great history of our country have we come to a wall seemingly too high to scale only to throw our caps to the other side?
[on T.V.] Tomorrow… tomorrow morning, we're going to begin to change the way elections are supervised in this country.
[on T.V.] I am proud to nominate John Branford Bacon and Patricia Calhoun to the Federal Election Commission.
Al…
We don't care do we, Sam?
Kiefer's been here 45 minutes, he's already got me on the playground at recess.
Toby was just explaining to Al that science is science to everyone.
Go.
Can't sell science?
I'm hungry and so far nobody has convinced me of anything.
[groggily] Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, that's cause I answered the phone. [turns on the lamp]
What's on your mind? [waves for Leo to come in]
Yeah, I got to be up in four hours, anyway.
About what?
Well, I wasn't listening to a lot of it.
Leo, if there's anyone qualified to talk about the benefits of treatment vs. criminal action, it's you. Is there anyone whose life would be better right now, if you'd had gone to jail instead of rehab?
Thank you. Is there anything else?
Apparently there is.
Yeah.
I am.
You fixed it this afternoon, right?
Then let's move on.
No need to apologize, but I accept your apology and now I'm ready, if not eager, to move on.
How you doin'?
Not for a little while now.
Not tonight.
Guys, let me tell you what I would like to have happen, right now.
Josh walking in the door wasn't even close.
I'm fine, thanks. How you doing?
See, the part I don't understand is, I got like, 24 armed guards right outside my bedroom door…
I'm a day closer. There'll be more meetings tomorrow. In the meantime, everybody calm down. Leo's got your engines fired like you're running Daytona. That's fine. Keep them there. Guess what? Mistakes are gonna be made. Minimize them, fix them, move on. Kiefer's numbers got you scared? Listen to me. I have never lost an election in my life. We do this right, people are going to respond. You all had a good day.
You guys should feel free to do this when my wife is here.
Everybody. Mandy was doing her job. It's time to let her out of the doghouse.
[to Leo] She was doing her job. C.J.?
So was Danny.
Good night.
We were almost done.
When you were married to her, did you call her Congresswoman Wyatt?
Sometimes I call my wife, Dr. Bartlet.
Okay.
You're whupped, my friend.
No, she's been talking to your for a year about Mandatory Minimums. You've been saying no. Looks like we know who wears the pants in the Ziegler family.
Just for the turn-on.
Andy.
Yes.
Yes, they are.
And it will be.
[to Leo] I'm sleeping better. [beat] When I sleep, I dream about a great discussion with experts and ideas and diction and energy and honesty. And when I wake up, I think, "I can sell that."
Good night.
