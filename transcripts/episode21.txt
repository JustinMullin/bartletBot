Not at all, we're just having a nightcap.
Oh, may I present Treasury Secretary, Kenneth…
Mr. Attorney General.
Our CIA Director, Rob Conrad.
Barry, I'm Jed Bartlet. I understand you're thinking about helping us out. It makes me so happy. [shakes Barry's hand]
Well, let's get him a drink.
Leo… [walks towards Leo]
This could all be for nothing.
I mean, if the numbers… [points downward]
Did we start?
All right. Did the guys make any predictions?
Yes, you did.
It could be worse.
I mean it could be worse than holding at 42.
'Cause if these numbers keep going down, I'm just a guy with Barry Haskell in his office.
A dress Marine guarding your door?
Nah… My thing is, what's he suppose to be guarding right now?
Thanks.
Based on what?
Based on what is he making that claim?
We've been out there for three weeks.
Good morning, Charlie.
We've been… we've been out there for three weeks. Crossfire, Meet the Press, Charlie Rose, The Today Show, The Tonight Show, Good Morning Scottsdale…
…Time, Newsweek, Popular Mechanics. We've been out there saying we're not talking about legalization. We are talking about treatment.
Well, how do you want to handle it?
I don't know. It sounds like we're soft on the issue.
Steve Onorato is saying I want to legalize drugs.
Hmmm… Leo was in here last night. He said you guys predicted we'd hold steady at 42. Were you just being optimistic or you really think we held our ground.
Sorry?
Yeah?
Well, okay. Anybody want to offer C.J. the odds?
[to C.J.] Talk to the press.
Tell them every administration for the past thirty years has generated that memo.
That's it.
[closes the door] Thank you. [to Toby and Sam] What do you got?
[sits down with a cup of tea] It is a country. You know where?
It's actually 607 small islands in the South Pacific. Interestingly, while its total land mass is only 270 square miles, it occupies more than a million square miles of the Pacific Ocean. Population is 127,000 and the U.S. Embassy is located in the state of Pohnpei and not, as many people believe, on the island of Yap.
Parties.
I looked at the Federated States of Micronesia. I can't fire our ambassador.
Somebody's going to ask me why I fired him and I'm not gonna be able to come up with the answer they're looking for.
How?
To what?
And what happens to the ambassador of Paraguay?
Hey, I like this. Of course, if everybody keeps moving up one, then I get to go home.
That ambassador is Ken Cochran, isn't it?
He's having an affair with the daughter of the Bulgarian Prime Minister?
I can imagine.
Prime Minister of Bulgaria?
I know his wife.
I got to fire Ken Cochran?
All right, then I don't want it to be because of the girl.
I know his wife.
Well, it looks to me like there are legitimate grounds for incompetence, but… come up with different ones, would you?
All right, let's do it.
Charlie!
I need to meet with Ambassador Cochran. He can be found in his office at the U.S Embassy in Bulgaria, or not. Either way, I'd like the State Department to put his ass on a plane and have it in this office tomorrow.
Thank you.
Yeah.
What?
It looked like when I said "Ken Cochran", that you knew who he was.
Okay.
You never paid this girl to have sex?
Well, that makes two of us.
Laurie's the girl?
Toby, are you in here sticking up for Sam?
[big sigh] Sam, you're going to spend the morning in the White House Counsel's office finding out if you've broke any laws.
You should also call the girl… what's her name?
You should call her and tell her the White House deeply regrets the phenomenal inconvenience she's about to experience.
You might also want to point out to her that she probably has a cause of action against the paper.
And you should tell her that if she passes her Bar exam, the U.S. Attorney General will personally see to it that she's admitted to the Bar.
Tell her the President of the United States says congratulations on getting her degree.
That's all.
It's nice when we can do something for prostitutes once in a while, isn't it?
Are we ready to go?
Where are we putting Lobell and his people?
He's going to have a lot of staff with him.
I don't know what any of them do, but there they are where ever Lobell goes, 14-15 guys….
I'm going to take care of this first and I'll see you across the hall.
Who's in the Mural room?
You did it again.
When you said the name 'Cochran', it was like you knew him.
I have a sense about these things.
A finely honed sense.
Cochran's in the Mural room?
Why don't you go sit with him and send in Ted Mitchell.
Thank you.
Yes, of course. [takes a pen and signs something] Thank you.
Ted.
Thank you for coming.
You're looking good.
How is Mary?
All right, listen. I have something to do in the next room. Let me just tell you that I need a favor.
I need you to hire a guy.
A former ambassador to Bulgaria.
Ken Cochran.
Not for long. Look, he's a good man, a smart man; I think he'd make a very good corporate officer.
Gross incompetence. I'll be right back.
Good morning, Nancy.
Yeah, I'll be right in.
Ken.
Thank you for flying in on such short notice.
Resign.
You've been having an affair with the daughter of the Prime Minister and that doesn't work for me. But neither does the newspaper article saying you're having an affair with the daughter of the Prime Minister. So, I need you to resign. You're going to get a job offer from Ted Mitchell for a lot more money than you're making now, that's why you left the Embassy. I'll be back in a minute.
[comes back in] Thanks for waiting.
It doesn't have anything to do with… Oh, wait a second. You two have a past?
You mocked my finely honed sense.
You stood there in my face…
It's done Ken. Ted Mitchell's going to put you on the Board of Directors, and please remember that I have a lot of affection for your wife, and I would hate to see her be made a fool of.
What's that?
Well, thanks for trying, but here I am anyway. Got to go.
Look at that. 14 staffers in there.
Yeah, but I don't walk around with them, you know?
Good morning.
Max, I don't need to know all the names. It's okay. Please, sit down.
You know what we're doing here, right?
We're going to do more than talk about it.
We agree on nothing, Max.
Education, guns, drugs, school prayer, gays, defense spending, taxes, you name it, we disagree.
'Cause I'm a lily-livered, bleeding-heart, liberal, egg head, communist.
Yes, you are.
We also agree on campaign finance.
So, Max.
Let's work together on campaign finance.
I don't need them. 1978, the FEC voted a regulatory rule that opened the door to soft money. The FEC can close it again with 4 of the 6 votes. We don't need a law.
Two seats opened up, I nominated Bacon and Calhoun.
Barry Haskel was with us already. We took him out of the closet.
Toby's going to take care of that right away. Max, can I count on your support to confirm my candidates?
[beat] The thanks of a grateful President.
[to Toby] Go.
[to Lobell] Thank you.
Kassenbach was okay?
Kassenbach was okay?
Did you tell him about the weather?
Scuba diving?
Full diplomatic immunity?
Sure.
Good evening, Josh.
We're having a fight with Alexis de Tocqueville?
Yeah.
What kind of briefcase did you get her, Sam?
What kind of briefcase?
That's nice.
Andare makes a nice model. Comes in black or brown, hand stained, fit a laptop, notebooks, the works.
Trieste in Milan makes a nice briefcase.
Okay, what's next?
