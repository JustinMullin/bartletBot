I don't think I answered the last one. Suzanne's got me telling jokes. Here's an answer to your question that I don't think you're going to like the current crop of 18-25 year olds is the most politically apathetic generation in American history. In 1972, half of that age group voted. In the last election, 32%. Your generation is considerably less likely than any previous one to write or call public officials, attend rallies, or work on political campaigns. A man once said this, "decisions are made by those who show up." So are we failing you, or are you failing us? It's a little of both.
. . .there's a guy on my staff who showed me a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that said 61% of your age group agree with the statement "Politicians and political officials -
Generation x advocacy group third millennium, 53 of 18 to 25 year olds believe the soap opera General Hospital will outlast Medicare. This from a generation convinced that the generation before them has ransomed their generation's future. That's why my youngest daughter Zoey is always mad at me.
This is the part where Zoey tries to crawl under a seat to hide. Don't worry about it, sweetie, I'll bring out the baby pictures any second now.
It seems to me that if this event is over by 10:00, then I can be back here by 11, and you know what that means.
Did you just snicker when you said that?
Yes, you did.
Thanks, Lou. [to Charlie] When you said Girls Softball Game, you snickered.
Yes, you snickered. As if to indicate there was something wrong with my wanting to see a girls' softball game live via satellite.
Thanks, Phil. [to Charlie, whom he leads down the hall] I am excited about it! You come to the end of a long day, you sit back, you open a beer, you watch a sporting event. That's what men do.
If that's what's on, then that's what they watch. It's either that, or a cricket match between Scotland and Bermuda. Now, I am an educated man, Charlie, but when someone tries to explain cricket to me, all I want to do is hit him in the head with a teapot.
Good morning, Patty. [to Charlie] So, it's softball. Sacramento State versus the University of the Pacific.
Now, you're not going to spoil my fun.
I'm going to get back at the end of the day, sit back, open a beer…
That's right!
Hey, Steve. Hey, Mikey. [to Charlie] Listen, have I got any of the names right so far?
Okay.
Good morning, everybody!
Sure.
And when I speak, I should stand facing the audience, right?
Do you know how I know this, C.J.? Because I've done it 2,000 to 300,000 times before. [to Sam, who just walked in] Hey, Sam.
Why didn't the Columbia land last night?
The Space Shuttle was supposed to land last night, someone told me that it didn't.
Why don't you go ask Toby?
His brother's on that flight.
He's a payload specialist.
He's up there with four red-bellied Japanese newts. He wants to see how a newt's inner ears, which are remarkably similar to humans, are influenced by the absence of gravity. [to C.J.] Do you know what he calls them, C.J.?
100% right. [to Sam] Go ask him why it didn't land.
C.J., you say I have a pitcher of water and a drinking glass. Now the water gets into the glass how?
I proposed
I wouldn't say my administration is nibbling around the edges.
I agree with you that far too many Americans don't have adequate access to health insurance, and that far too many of them are children. Yes, we can and we must do more.
Hang on. [to Josh] Now can I blame Congress?
Is the pilot still alive?
He's in the middle of nowhere.
Our guy is ten miles from the Fourth Corps of the Iraqi Republican Guard?
What's his name?
The pilot. What's his name?
Where's he from?
How old is he?
Rob told me in my intelligence briefing last week that the Iraqi government has put out a bounty the equivalent of 14,000 dollars U.S on any American plane shot down, or any American soldier captured. Now, he was just patrolling the No Fly zone, right?
He had not engaged.
Bill, if it ends up that Fitzwallace has to call this kid's parents, I swear to God I'm invading Baghdad. [to Fitzwallace] Get him back.
Expanding healthcare coverage for 5 million more poor children.
Making healthcare portable for people who change jobs.
You know what's hard about all this, C.J.?
I'm rehearsing here without the pitcher and glass, it's totally weird for me.
No, because with the mike and the stool, and the jacket thrown over my shoulder, and I can do the town hall meeting, and then do a couple of sets at the Copa.
My musical director, Zoey Bartlet.
We're down to do I or do I not take my jacket off.
I honestly couldn't care less. Listen, I want you to come with us tonight.
I'm fine.
Yeah.
Zoey!
Are you channeling Mom, now?
Come to Virginia tonight.
It's not like being there in person.
Bonus. Then it's settled.
Okay.
And you're coming tonight.
Thanks. [to Gina, who's waiting near the door] Gina.
All right, everyone, we're done. Thanks very much.
Charlie, Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention?
Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention.
Are you sure?
Okay.
Yeah?
A signal for what?
What kind of signal did you have in mind?
What is that?
No, that one's good.
Well, I think it's going to get around all by itself, but if you want to help it along a little, there's nothing wrong with that.
Yeah?
Thanks.
No. Hey, what was it that Zoey was talking about before?
What was it?
It has?
What's the report?
Yeah?
Thank you.
Charlie, whatever it is, stick it in my briefcase, would you?
Thank you.
Fitz, do you have any news at all?
Okay.
No.
I feel fine.
Yeah, I feel fine.
I don't know.
I honestly don't know, Fitz.
Fitz…
The kid's all right?
Well, that's, that's a job awfully well done, Mr. Chairman.
I owe you one.
All the same, I'm going to check out that thing with the carpet.
Seriously, I'm going to get an answer for you on that.
Captain Hutchins, this is President Bartlet. How's your ankle? Good. Now before you say another word, give me your parents' phone number. I never get to make this call.
Womens' softball. It's going to be great. Mrs. Landingham? I'm watching a live sporting event from beginning to end tonight.
You're not going to spoil my good time for me, Mrs. Landingham.
Yeah.
Do you see me walking out the door?
I'm leaving.
[handing Leo his briefcase] You know what, I'll be at the car in just a second.
Thank you.
Toby?
Toby.
You can't see them, they're over Australia now. I just spoke with the mission commander. They're trying firing something called an RCS?
If that doesn't work, they've got about 39 other things they can try. There's redundancy after redundancy after redundancy built in. And for good measure, they have Atlantis warming up on the launch pad. It can dock with the Columbia in about two hours. We can do that now, Toby.
Then they'll open those doors again.
Same way they closed them - with a five-dollar wrench.
When we're done tonight, you should take the next flight out to Edwards' Air Force Base, meet the thing when it lands, stop being a horse's ass, and talk to your brother.
Shuttle flies itself, Toby.
No, it doesn't.
Thank you, thank you very much. That was a joke about politicians. [audience laughter] Two politicians are having an argument. The first one yells, 'but you're lying!' and the other one answers, 'yes, I know, but hear me out!"
I don't think I answered the last one. Suzanne's got me telling jokes. Here's an answer to your question that I don't think you're going to like. A man once said this, "decisions are made by those who show up." So are we failing you, or are you failing us? [hand shake] A little of both. There's a guy on my staff named Charlie Young, he showed me a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that says that 61% of you agree with the statement "The older generation has failed my generation". When asked how the older generation sees you, your top answers are "lazy", "confused," and "unfocused".
If I take my jacket off, can I trust you all to read nothing more into it than I've been talking for two hours and it's a little hot under these lights?
They're telling me that we're out of time. I just want to mention that at several points during the evening, I was referred to as both a liberal and a populist, and a fellow fourth from the back called me a socialist, which is nice, I haven't heard that for a while.
…and announced to the world that we were no longer subjects of King George III, but rather a self-governing people. We hold these truths to be self-evident, they said, that all men are created equal. Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in history that anyone had bothered to write that down. Decisions are made by those who show up. Class dismissed. Thank you, everyone. God bless you. And God bless America.
Toby! Walk with me.
What have you got to say for yourself?
