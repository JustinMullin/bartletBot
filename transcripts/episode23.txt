Get her again.
Get her on the radio, please!
Why can't she talk?
Why the hell?
Why is she vomiting?
Ron…
Is Gina with her?
She's not with her?
Why isn't Gina in the car?
Is anybody dead back there?
What happened to your hand?!
Oh God. [to the driver] Coop, turn around, we gotta go to the hospital.
We're going to the hospital! Let's go!
This is… my daughter is throwing up on the floor in the car behind us. You're losing blood by the liter, not to mention how many broken bones you got in your hand, but let's make sure that I'm tucked in bed before we do anything…
I swear to God if I don't speak to my daughter in the next five minutes, I'm gonna attack someone.
[indicating Ron] This guy's got about seven broken bones in his hand, by the way. If somebody wants to give him an aspirin or something…
Listen, I want you to wait as long as you can before you give me the anesthesia. I need to speak to Leo McGarry before you give me the anesthesia.
Well… I've been shot.
I'm okay.
They didn't hit anything. They're just gonna look around and make sure.
No.
Yeah, 'cause I want these guys to tell reporters that I was brave and joking around.
[sighs] Honey, I'm fine. I'm just so happy to see you.
Mom's gonna be pretty pissed.
She booted all over the back of her car. You know they're gonna bill me for that.
Honey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell her not to frighten the doctors. I'll see you in a couple hours.
I love you too, hon.
Anybody killed back there?
Anybody in the crowd?
What about our people?
[beat] Get the cabinet together and the Security Council. Tell Jerome to suspend trading on the stock exchange.
Do we know who the shooters were?
I'm gonna be under anesthesia for a couple hours.
You know what I'm talking about, right?
[to Leo] Hey. Come here.
It's okay.
…Consumer price index, we tend to be late in responding to these trends, and we get what doctors call a "false positive". The science of economics is a lot less an exact science that we pretend. We build complex models with thousands of interdependent and independent variables.
Let me put it another way: you and your husband pay $600 more every year than you would if you were unmarried, living together, and filing individually. Couples living outside the covenant of marriage do so.
…which then again is a much larger tax on overstated real profits.
You really didn't understand any of that, right?
Me too. Yeah?
[pause] Yeah, I screwed you on that one.
I screwed you. You got hosed.
And not just you. A lot of my constituents. I put the hammer to farms in Concord, Salem, Laconia, and Elem.
You guys got rogered but good.
Today, for the first time in history, one in five Americans living in poverty are children.
One in five children live in the most abject, dangerous, hopeless, backbreaking, gut wrenching, poverty, one in five, and they're children. If fidelity to freedom and democracy is the code of our civic religion then surely, the code of our humanity is faithful service to that unwritten commandment that says "We shall give our children better than we ourselves had." I voted against the bill 'cause I didn't want it to be hard for people to buy milk. I stopped some money from flowing into your pocket. If that angers you, if you resent me, I completely respect that, but if you expect anything different from the President of the United States, I suggest you vote for somebody else. Thanks very much. Hope you enjoyed the chicken.
I wanna see him.
Please. Help me to the door.
Charlie brought me some clothes. Please let me see him.
Great.
What's next?
I understand.
I understand the point that Cal was making. I was sitting next to him when he made it, my ears are connected to my brain just like every body else. And I'm saying what's next?
You're not afraid he's gonna make me look like I can't remember his name?
I am. I think it's going to make me look like I can't remember his name. I think it's going to make me look addled. I think it's going to make me look dotty. And even if it didn't make me look like those things it would remain a stupid idea. What's next? Nothing? Excellent. [leaves]
Did you just fire Cal Mathis?
You fired him.
Is there anyone you kept?
Oh, you kept Toby Ziegler, and you fired everyone else.
Toby Ziegler is the only person working for us I don't know, and he's the one you kept!
Those were the only people I know.
So you made that decision on your own.
You know I got elected to Congress by this state. This state sent me to Congress three times and elected me Governor all without your help.
Don't start!
Hey.
You got rid of all the people I know!
Why are you doing this? You're a player. You're bigger in the party than I am. Hoynes would make you national chairman. Leo! Tell me this isn't one of the twelve steps.
Leo.
And you think I'm that man.
Does it matter that I'm not as sure?
Yeah.
Look what happened.
