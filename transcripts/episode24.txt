We don't know what the injury count is, yet.
Yeah. Charlie, the guy the Secret Service has in custody is named Carl Leroy. He gives a statement in which he says that he and the two shooters were members of an organization called West Virginia White Pride.
Go.
[to Abbey] We don't know what the injury count is, yet.
I blew it. What's next?
What's… next?
Which one is Toby?
[to Josh] And which one are you?
The New Hampshire primary isn't held in New Hampshire anymore?
I am going to win the New Hampshire primary.
I appreciate that, thanks.
I know what he meant.
We're not going to beat Hoynes in South Carolina.
[to Leo] Wiley's going to drop out after South Carolina?
Are we going to get his endorsement?
It's for sure?
Which one is Josh?
Okay.
Well, that's it, then. And we saved people the trouble of voting. What's next?
I understand the point. We're going to South Carolina to set up Illinois. When I ask, "What's next?", it means that I'm ready to move on to other things. So, what's next?
Fantastic.
What the hell is this?
"I congratulate my opponent on a well-fought campaign in Illinois"?
Yes, I want to congratulate him, but I'd like to call him by his name! Are we back to this old crap again?
Leo, I want to go over this whole thing with you.
Josh?
Your father died, Josh. I can't believe it.
What happened?
It's a blood clot.
Yeah… Yeah.
He was a lawyer?
Did he like that you were in politics?
[chuckling] He would've.
He'd have been doing some bragging?
He was already. Trust me, Josh, I'm a father. He was already.
Nah, I'm okay.
They'll wait.
I've been a real jackass to you, Josh.
To everybody. Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn.
Don't think I don't know what you gave up to work on this campaign, and don't think that I don't know your value. And I'll never make you think I don't again. You got to be a little impressed that I got all those names right just now.
You want me to go with you?
Maybe you want some company on the plane.
I could get a ticket and come with you.
I guess you're right.
They're calling your flight.
He's going to be fine.
Leo?
I'm ready.
I couldn't hear you, Josh.
He said, "What's next?"
