Good morning, everybody. Anybody know what the word 'acalculia' means?
Yeah, but I'll get over it. [starts to sit down]
Shut up.
No.
Well 19% of the country has clearly made up their minds about me; 20% just feel sorry for me. This is what you want if you're the leader of the free world. Give us an over view.
C.J., if you get questions about the midterms, say "we haven't thought that far ahead due to recent events."
I'll let you know. Thank you very much, everyone.
(reads the note) It's fine. Tell them around 3 o'clock.
Was Zoey out there?
Is she still here?
Okay. [starts to gather his files] Leo.
Did you know Elliot Roush is running to for the school board in Manchester?
Elliot Roush.
My Elliot Roush.
I beat him in my first Congressional campaign.
I want some polling numbers on that race.
Yeah, 'cause looking at two numbers on a piece of paper really takes the life out of me.
Get me the numbers. Let me tell you something…
…I'm ready to go out there.
I don't need to wait another week.
Get away from me.
46%.
The guy is polling at 46%.
They didn't. I had to have our guys do it.
He's polling at 46%. He's not a joke. He's polling inside the margin.
It has 1100 kids, and you don't take these people seriously 'cause they don't get anywhere nationally, but they don't have to. All they have to do is, bit by little bit, get themselves on the Boards of Education and city councils. 'Cause that's where all the governing that really matters to anybody really happens.
I'm on hold with a guy whose name I've got on an index card. How much governing do you think is going on around here today? And can you believe I'm on hold?
I did?
How'd it go?
Elliot Roush is now polling at 46%.
I had our people…
[gets up off the bed] I have 3 daughters who grew up in that school district.
And he has come back. Like crab grass pulled from the lawn. Not by the root, but by the other thing.
They're going fine.
Can't tell you how much I'm going to miss you. (to Zoey) You wanted to talk to me?
(big sigh) This is real and a man, who makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a Barbara Walters Special, is now polling at 46% in your school district, for which I have personally baked things to raise money. (to C.J.) You can go, too.
(sternly) You can go.
What do you want?
Do we know how Tokyo opened?
Is that it for me?
Wyman?
Frank Gates and McNamara?
Those are campaign calls.
Because I choose not to, Charlie. Because, however an empty gesture it may seem, I would like to take some executive notice of the notion that it's probably not a good idea for the most powerful and influential person in the world to be calling up the people whose laws he signs and asking them for money! (beat) I'm going to do it, but not behind this desk and not in this room. What else?
Yeah. (takes the phone messages) I'll make these calls from the Residence. Tell C.J. I want to see her in an hour.
Come in.
Hi, C.J.
Yeah. Why has there been no press mentioned that the fact that Elliot Roush was an opponent of mine in New Hampshire?
He's running for a seat on the school board up in New Hampshire.
Why isn't it more than local?
It's a human interest story.
I'm saying, if anyone in the Press Room wanted to do this story that I would comment on the record.
Why can't he?
I don't care about winning back the House.
I don't care about winning back the House!
C.J., I've known men of faith in my life. Towering men. Men of wisdom and compassion. Men of all faiths, of healing and peace. Pro choices, pro-life, Republican, Democrat, men and women of God. Elliot Roush… (long beat) …is polling at 53%. He's polling at 53%. He's the front runner.
Yeah. It was just a thought, but I mean, obviously, you're right.
Thanks.
Toby, I'm drinking the most fantastic thing I've ever tasted in my life: chocolate syrup, cold milk, and seltzer. I know it sounds terrible, but trust me, I don't know where this has been all my life.
In Brooklyn.
Not New England?
Toby, don't ever let me hear you say that again.
What's on your mind?
You want to take a leave of absence.
That's no problem, Toby.
Not a problem at all.
15 minutes.
It's time to get up off the mat, Toby.
Toby.
[rises from his chair] It wasn't a shooting, Toby. It was a lynching. They tried to lynch Charlie right in front of our eyes, can you believe that?
Keyhole satellite photographs. It's the headquarters for West Virginia White Pride headquarters. It's a diner outside Blacksberg. Every night for the past 12 weeks, I've picked up the phone and called the Attorney General, fully prepared to say two wordstake 'em. And then I hang up the phone because I know it'll be better tomorrow and better the day after that. We saw a lynching, Toby. That's why it feels like this.
I'm not sure I can either. But until we are sure, I think we should keep coming into work every day. [sits back down]
Yeah, he's gonna win.
I don't remember. I've been thinking about it for weeks, but I honestly don't remember.
Hey, Sam.
Let me look at them while we walk. Toby, go with us, to this radio thing.
There'll be crab puffs. New England crab puffs, by the way, made in New England.
There's Alaskan crab in this White House?
Have you tried them?
Were they good?
Let's get there.
Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thanks a lot. I wish I could spend more than a few minutes with you but the polls don't close in the east for another hour and there are plenty of election results left to falsify.
You know with so many people participating in the political and social debate through call in shows, it's a good idea to be reminded…
…it's a good idea to be reminded of the awesome impact… the awesome impact…
I'm sorry, um… you're Dr. Jenna Jacobs, right?
It's good to have you here.
The awesome impact of the airwaves and how that translates into the furthering of our national discussions but obviously also how it can… how it can…
Forgive me, Dr. Jacobs. Are you an M.D.?
A Ph.D.?
In Psychology?
Theology?
Social work?
I'm asking, 'cause on your show, people call in for advice and you go by the name of Dr. Jacobs on your show. And I didn't know if maybe your listeners were confused by that, and assumed you had advanced training in Psychology, Theology, or health care.
Good. I like your show. I like how you call homosexuality an abomination.
Yes, it does. Leviticus.
Chapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here. I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. (small chuckles from the guests) She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, and always clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, LeoO McGarry, insists on working on the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really important, 'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching the skin of a dead pig makes us unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be together to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads?
Think about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may be mistaking this for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in this building, when the President stands, nobody sits.
Toby.
That's how I beat him.
