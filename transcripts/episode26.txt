Would you like me to show you the list of dead millionaires?
Leo, AIDS is caused by HIV. You just named a group of people that have a higher mortality rate across the board. Morning, Charlie.
Where are we?
Thank you.
They have a Health Minister who doesn't think AIDS is connected to HIV!
[stopping at his desk] Hey, did you see Sam get purEed last night on Capital Beat? [puts on his glasses]
He got diced and sliced by a woman named Ainsley Hayes.
I know, I had Charlie pull 'em for me. Where's she been?
We should hire her.
No, I mean it.
We should hire her.
No, not as a joke, I mean we should hire her as a reality. We should hire her.
So are half the people in this country.
She's smart, she's not just carping. She feels a sense of something.
Yeah. [to Leo] Of duty. Of civic duty.
Three.
I can sense civic duty a mile away.
Morning.
Good morning.
Morning everybody.
Good morning, Mr. President.
[to the press] You can tell your caption editors that Bartlet's the third guy from the right.
Katie.
[sarcastic] Yes, Katie, I'm trying to shore up the sub-Saharan vote.
It's an international health crisis; there's nothing I'm not considering.
[nodding] That's right. His name is Norman Borlaug, by the way, and he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.
[to Nimbala] I think you're absolutely right about the kind of miracle we need. I think we're gonna make a lot of progress in the next few days.
It was called dwarf wheat, which produces heavy yields without its stalk falling over from the weight of the rain.
What am I, Farmer Bob? It was wheat, and there was more than there used to be.
And hire that girl.
Ainsley Hayes.
Why?
[waggling a finger at him] Not one of those.
Leo, as hard as you might try, the Republican Party isn't going anywhere.
I don't think so.
Charlie, I want to hire a woman whose voice I think would fit in nicely around here, she's a conservative Republican. Do you think I should do it?
Leo.
We might do that, Leo. A hundred million Republicans; we might hire as many as two of them. But for now, hire this girl.
[shrugging] I don't know. She's a lawyer. Put her in the counsel's office.
Yes.
Appeal to her sense of duty. And smooth it over with the staff. Really, I don't want to hear from them.
Yes, she can.
Thank you.
Charlie.
When they close the book on me and you, it will say that at this moment you were not there for me, and for that, obviously, there'll be some kind of punishment.
600?
Television and radio?
When do I see pictures, and who's gonna tell me what I'm looking for?
[looking at his watch] I want Fitzwallace and Nancy.
[nodding towards him] Leo.
Mr. President, three hours ago there was a coup in your country. The AFRC has taken the capital.
We're finding out. The information's coming very quickly now from our people in Angola and Sudan. Mr. President, I think you should sit.
No, no, sir! My State Department is offering you asylum in the U.S.
You can't go home. You can't go home!
They have the capital, they have the radio station, they have the television station.
I'm evacuating the embassy.
Yes.
I don't need to trade you! If they won't give me the Americans, we'll go and get 'em ourselves, and they know that, and they'll let 'em go.
They will shoot you the moment you step off the plane.
We think your brother and your two sons are already dead. We think your wife is being hidden in Kenya. You understand, don't you, why I can't offer military assistance?
Sit down, sir.
Then Norman Borlaug comes along. See the problem was wheat is top-heavy. It was falling over on itself and it took up too much space. The dwarf wheatâ€¦ guys, it was an agricultural revolution that was credited with saving one billion lives.
They executed him in the airport parking lot.
Okay. I'll see you Monday. He gets up and leaves the office.
