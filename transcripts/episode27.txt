How's it going?
That's almost hard to believe, Donna. [to the guests] How is everybody?
Not quite.
The speech.
Thank you. Let's do this in one, shall we?
One-take Bartlet. That's what old Jack Warner used to call me.
Good morning. This month, as autumn is in full bloom in much of the nation, the weekends will be devoted by many of you to leaf peeping and football… watch… ing…
[still laughing] I'm sorry. Leaf peeping? Is that something we do now?
I heard that.
Sorry, everybody. This is gonna be it. Four is my lucky number.
Five is my lucky number. "Fifth-take Bartlet" -- that's what Jack Warner used to call me.
Yeah, because I used to be a contract player in Hollywood and I'm 97 years old.
Here we go.
'Our farming families stand for the values that keep our nation strong: faith, calm perseverance, and patience…'
I had it!
It's a bit of a bad time, Lionel…
And we will, Lionel, but right now I don't know if you noticed but there are thirty or forty other people in the room, many of whom have donated significant amounts of money to the Democratic Party, so perhaps you could put a tighter grip on your horses and we will talk about it later.
Well, obviously, Lionel Tribbey is a brilliant lawyer whom we cannot live without, or there would be very little reason not to put him in prison. Let's try again.
Really?
Good afternoon, Mrs. Landingham.
[to Mrs. Landingham] Go away right now.
Not for long, Mrs. Landingham.
Absolutely!
Who cares? It's been 14 weeks! Do these curtains close?
Yes. You're right… where?
New Hampshire is an hour and a half away by plane. I don't think I have that kind of time.
[excited] Yes! We have a bedroom right here in the building. That was so smart!
Let's go!
What?
Oh God… I hate plutonium!
What happens at six?
Where the hell is Cochran's Mills?
Right.
[grabs her, smiling] I don't think it's gonna take more than a couple of minutes, but I like your confidence.
Can't we just close the curtains?
Is this still my first term?
Here we go.
Good evening.
It's evening. It's dark outside, Charlie.
What time is it?
Excuse me… No. I can't. I've got to go.
Kids, I am so sorry. I have to go now, to a special meeting… of the government. I will mail you all an autographed copy of the picture we took together. And one day, you will all understand.
Take a break, Charlie.
I'm going to a special meeting…
Sure. Would you like to get that smile off your face before I send you on special assignment to the Yukon?
Guys, it's very important that nobody tries to kill me in the next hour or so.
I was on a conference call with Cardinal Law and the Archbishop of Chicago.
Yeah. "Excuse me, Your Eminence, but the First Lady is a little randy, and she says I'm good to go".
[sits and takes off his shoes] Good, take your clothes off.
Get 'em off.
Abbey, you have two minutes, or I swear to God I'm gonna get Mrs. Landingham drunk.
What was that thing you were doin'?
Tonight, in Pennsylvania.
It was a monument dedication, a statue?
Statue to who?
You went all the way to Cochran's… whatever to dedicate a monument to Nellie Bly? Abbey, you can really pass that kind of thing along.
You don't have to accept every invitation from every yahoo historical society that knows someone in the Social Office. If you want, I can have Charlie--
You haven't changed into the "special garment".
Yeah. You know what I did, just then, that was stupid? [laughs] I minimized the importance of the statue that was dedicated to Nellie Bly, an extraordinary woman to whom we all owe a great deal.
This isn't happening to me.
Then she's the one I want to beat the crap out of.
Yes, Abigail--
She sounds like an incredible woman, Abbey. I'm particularly impressed that she beat a fictional record. If she goes twenty-one thousand leagues under the sea I'll name a damn school after her. Let's have sex.
I couldn't possibly hear about the rest of the iceberg right now.
Keep talking. I'm just gonna sit here and think about plutonium and the things I can do with it.
Ellen Swallow Richards, the first woman to be a professional chemist. Maria Mitchell, who discovered a comet in 1847, and was the first woman admitted to the Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Oh I could go on and on, and on, and on. The fact remains that of all the monuments built with public money, only fifty of them pay tribute to the women who helped build this country, and opened its doors to all our daughters who would follow. In the coming months, I'll try to persuade Congress to rectify that. In the meantime, enjoy your weekend. God bless you, and God bless America.
Do it live, that's what I always say.
By the way, sweet knees, the Statue of Liberty.
Right there at the front door to the country!
Like a lawn jockey.
No, it's okay. [stage whispers] I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Is this about Ed Barrie?
Go ahead and let him out of the box. Say what you want about Barrie, and I could say plenty, but the man was the first one in and the last one out of a war that I didn't want anything to do with. Man's earned the right to say whatever he wants. Let him out of the box, would you?
Anything else?
I'm outta here.
