It's like trying to run the country with Barnum Bailey and his sister Sue.
Leo, will it be possible for just two of them to speak at once?
[calling] Charlie!
Could I have a couple of aspirin and a weapon of some kind to kill people with?
Leo?
What do you want to do?
Thank you all.
When does Konanov get here?
No high level meetings, right?
Okay.
Yeah, but this could be window.
We've got see if it's doable.
It could be doable.
You got anything more to say?
Okay.
Thank you.
No more Rouge Nations, huh?
Well that was easy.
What's doing, Claudia Jean?
Yeah, let's do it.
Why not?
Yeah, they've been way off base.
Not so much the second one. But the first, third and fourth were silly. And the fourth was mean spirited.
Nah.
First of all, it wasn't Danny.
Nah. It's going to look petty and petulant. You know why?
Because it's petty and petulant.
Yeah, but not having to run for anything tends to help with honesty and decisiveness. [to Charlie] Thanks, Charlie, send Danny in, would you please?
I really don't, C.J. [beat] Is this personal?
I hear things, I don't understand most of it, but I hear it.
He's a great reporter, and you're a great Press Secretary. And that's why it was never going to work while the two of you had those jobs.
[calling] Hey, Danny.
Danny, I think you guys have had your heads up your asses for the last few weeks, I hope you don't mind me saying so.
Not only that, but I think you've been trying to bait me. Which is a waste of time, paper and ink. I'm like 50 times smarter than any of you will ever be. I have an election to win in two years, and I'm not about to alienate the Washington Post.
I'll tell you what I will do, though, I'm cancelling our subscription.
No, I meant just mine and Abbey's. I'll borrow a copy from somebody.
Yeah. Take it easy, Danny. [beat] C.J.'ll give you all the access you want.
Vasily! Vasily Konanov, why you're the last person I expected to be where they told me to go.
Thank you, Donna.
[to the agents] Thank you, gentlemen.
Vasily?
[pointing to the woman] I don't know who this is.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm not the transportation secretary. You will join the WTO when you reduce the 300% tariff on America cars, and with a nuclear weapon pointed at my head I will not talk to you about nuclear compatibility.
Vasily, you're a reformer and you're going to do good things in Eastern Europe and I'm looking forward to the day when you're President. But until that time comes, my State Department deals with the government of the Ukraine. Now you can go home and so exactly what you wanted to do. [beat] To say you met with the President of the United States.
[opening the door] You just did.
How ya doing?
Come.
Thanks, you can take off for the night, Charlie, we're done.
[beat] Tony Marino's going to abstain, huh?
He was a great public servant, Toby, a great Senator.
Yeah. and then he was voted out of office five years later by the people of Bristol.
I know. The fact is the opponents of the treaty are on both sides of the isle. You've got to respect them, Toby. They're politicians and they're flying in the face of overwhelming public opinion.
Can I tell you something, honestly? This is one of those situations where I couldn't give a damn what the people think. The complexities of a global arms treaty, the technological, the military, the diplomatic nuances, it's staggering, Toby. 82% of the people cannot possibly be expected to reach an informed decision. [beat] You want to call a session anyway?
Yeah. [long pause] Anything else?
You know we forget sometimes, in all the talk about democracy we forget it's not a democracy, it's a republic. People don't make the decisions, they choose the people who make the decisions. Could they do a better job choosing? Yeah. But when you consider the alternatives, anyway, Abbey's in New Hampshire, you want to come up for a cigar?
The day's over, Toby. We'll live to fight another one. Come up, and I'll beat your ass at chess.
Yes.
[calling ahead] If anyone's out there, I'm signing off. Have a good night.
