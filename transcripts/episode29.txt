He wants to meet with me on the way back?
On the way back?
The Assistant Energy Secretary is flying to Portland in the middle of the night so he can meet with me on Air Force One on the way back?
The day-to-day experience of my life has changed in many ways since taking this job.
How're you doing?
I'm sorry?
You didn't say 'Michigan sucks'?
I thought you said 'Michigan sucks.'
Yeah.
Whose?
You think they've got oil?
We gonna board them?
Anything else I should know?
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Thank you!
Hey, C.J.!
I think it's great you decided to make the trip.
Yes. I remember now. You made one of your funny, funny jokes.
Put it on.
Put it on.
Put it on!
Hey, photo op.
Let's hit the sky!
C.J.!
What does the island of Qais mean to you?
About two hours ago we stopped a Cyprus-flagged ship called "The Nicosia." We believe it to be carrying petroleum products out of Iraq, in violation of UN sanctions.
We board the stip, we test a sample of the oil, we determine its point of origin and if it's black-market, the oil company gets fined.
Yes.
It dramatically exceeds the fine! So what do you think we should do?
I agree. Charlie?
It would please me if you would lead the press in a rendition as we pass over South Bend.
All five verses, please.
You bet your ass!
What are we trying to do?
All right. The F-18 pilots?
Leo, just so they know--it's a tanker full of crude oil. If they miss the propeller and hit something else---
What was that?
Why?
I didn't know that.
Okay. Why don't I have a final draft of tomorrow morning's…?
What's wrong with it?
Sam wrote it.
All right. [hangs up]
Why?
It's a northeastern thing?
What about Miami and San Francisco?
Come in!
So pavement's going to win this battle?
Okay, thanks, Steve.
Thank you, Mike.
[putting on jacket] Ernesto Perez Balladares, former President of Panama. You know where he went to school? Notre Dame.
Was that a crack?
[as he and C.J. walk out] Yeah, but we gotta do it later. The Tokyo Exchange just opened and I'm gonna gauge the impact on Pacific Rim Banking Reforms. A subject economics scholars could take years on, I will take 20 minutes.
I thought we left on time.
You don't like late flights?
A long flight across the night? You know why late flights are good? Because we cease to be earthbound and burdened with practicality. Ask the impertinent question. Talk about the idea nobody has thought about yet. [pointing to Sam] Put it a different way.
If you absolutely must.
In education?
Mao took a lot of long plane flights, Toby. Look out your window. Is there anything more romantic than that? [pointing out cabin window]
No, we left at 905 because they thought my budget meeting might run over. But wouldn't that have been great if that was the reason?
[to Toby] You don't like "permanent revolution"?
We're flying, Toby. Live a little. [standing and walking to Charlie] Yeah?
Oh, Leo, just take the damn boat…
Actually, it was two rooms.
Italian stonecutters were paying her to teach their kids English in the basement of the rectory. They put up a wall and made it two rooms as a thank you gift.
I haven't heard the big idea yet.
Yeah. [reads from speech] "As you know, I began my campaign…'' [looks at Toby] What happened to 100,000 new teachers?
No money?
Toby!
We can give incentives.
Well, it's not doing the trick.
[stands and walks toward Charlie] Tuition incentives.
Talk, Charlie.
I find fault with that formula.
What?
Why can't that idea be floated?
That comes later.
Kick this around.
[walks to the door] I'll be in my study. It's an incredible sky tonight.
[on speakerphone] Yeah?
Yeah?
It doesn't do anything to hold the ship in Bahrain
Yeah. You know what's going to happen? They'll sell off the cargo in a friendly port. 780,000 metric tons of gas oil against a two million dollar fine for the oil company.
Which their profits from the sale will more than cover. We're not providing much of a disincentive to evade U.N. sanctions.
If we're going to have sanctions at all, I think we should make them stick. I think that we should confiscate the cargo, seize the ship, sell the oil and use the money to beef up anti-smuggling operations.
[to Leo] Yeah. In the future.
[to Leo] Hang on. [to C.J.] You need me?
[into phone] Yeah.
[sighs] Yeah.
I don't care about the constitutional argument. It's gay bashing. It's legislative gay bashing. How do I put my name on it?
Pocket veto's a politician's way out.
If I'm going to sign it in January, why am I vetoing it now?
I'm sure the gay community can't wait to thank me.
This is just wrong.
[getting worked up] You can look at the policy numbers and Article IV and Social Security benefits. It doesn't matter. It's just wrong. We shouldn't be defining love and we certainly shouldn't be ill-defining it. It's wrong. This is the job for… This is the job of somebody else.
It's wrong.
I should get out a rubber stamp that says 'Josiah Bartlet votes no.'
I should get out a rubber stamp!
Put it in a drawer.
Yeah?
Yeah.
There was a question?
Why not?
Because I was thinking about becoming a priest.
Yeah.
I met Abbey.
Because I like to bother you.
Sit down.
Toby.
Toby, you should sit down. We're landing in one minute and ten seconds.
I set my watch to the cockpit computer. You should sit down.
Do you know why the Assistant Energy Secretary is on the plane?
That's right.
They're taking the tanker to Bahrain and then the company's going to make a profit.
The Marriage Recognition Act is going to be law.
100 new teachers?
Instead of 100,000.
Well, it's a start I guess.
