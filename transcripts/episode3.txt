This is crap. It's been three days. This is amateur hour.
Cashman and Berryhill are dragging their feet. Cashman and Berryhill are trying to make me look like a clown. And State should concern itself with what I damn well tell 'em to be concerned with!
So I've discovered.
Good morning.
Good morning.
[standing behind his desk] Uh, Mrs. Landingham, I can't seem to find my glasses anywhere. Can you please do whatever it is you do when I can't find my glasses?
It's been 72 hours Leo. That's more than three days since they blew him out of the sky. And I'm tired of waiting dammit! This is candy ass! We are going to draw up a response scenario today, I'm going to give the order today, we're going to strike back today.
What?
You think I'm taking this personally.
Why the hell shouldn't I take this personally?
Americans were on that plane.
I met Morris four or five times, let's not do this like he was my son.
[yelling] Mrs. Landingham!
I can't fine my glasses anywhere.
Thank you.
[tries to read his watch] Uh, yeah, let's have him. [Mrs. Landingham leaves.] What did you want to say?
You sure?
All right, I'll see you in an hour.
Keep your seats. [Everyone sits back down.]
What have we got?
What is the virtue of a proportional response?
What's the virtue of a proportional response? Why's it good? [beat] They hit an airplane, so we hit a transmitter, right? That's a proportional response.
They hit a barracks, so we hit two transmitters?
It's what we do. I mean this is what we do.
Well, if it's what we do, if it's what we've always done, don't they know we're going to do it?
I have turned my attention to Pericles One, it's two ammo dumps, an abandoned railroad bridge and a Syrian intelligence agency.
But they know we're going to do that, they know we're going to do that. Those areas have been abandoned for four days. We know that from the satellites. We have the intelligence.
They did that, so we did this, it's the cost of doing business, it's been factored in, right?
Am I right or am I missing something here?
Then I ask again, what is the virtue of a proportional response?
It is not all there is.
A disproportional response. Let the word ring forth from this time and this place, you kill an American, any American, we don't come back with a proportional response, we come back [bangs fist on table] with total disaster!
General, I am suggesting that you and Admiral Fitzwallace and Secretary Hutchinson and the rest of the national security team take the next sixty minutes and put together a U.S. response scenario that doesn't make me think we are just docking somebody's damn allowance! [gets up and leaves the room. Everyone stands.]
Keep your seats. There's a delegation of cardiologists having their pictures taken in the Blue Room. You wouldn't think you could find a group of people more arrogant than the fifteen of us, but there they are right upstairs in the Blue Room. You called me?
[waves him off] Thank you. [beat] Does anyone have a cigarette?
This other plan…
Pericles One. No civilian causalities?
But you're as certain as you can be?
And what are the military implications?
Very well. [pause, to Leo] How does this work?
Fifty buck crime. [to Leo] I honestly don't know what the hell we're doing here. [leaves]
What happened to paragraph nine?
I'm sorry, paragraph eight.
Well, I want to see it again.
I can't look at anything fellas. Mrs. Landingham! I need my glasses!
When do we get the BDA?
Why!?
So what's the problem?
Oh, for crying out loud, will somebody get on the phone to CNN and find out if we hit anything!
Thank you! Now if I had my glasses.
This has been since this morning, we could have brought in an optometrist by now.
I don't need an optometrist now, thank you Nancy. I just need to glasses he prescribed.
I got the briefing on the phoenix.
The phoenix. I got the briefing on the phoenix last night, I studied the report, Hutchinson was there, in my private study.
The phoenix, the A61, the sparrow, and the sidewinder. Are we covered?
Very well.
For want of a pair of glasses.
Thank you. [tries on C.J.'s glasses]
Aw, crap. I can't see anything with those.
What!?
What of it? Who is this?
I don't have anytime for new people now!
What do you need, Leo?
[pause] Did you know that two thousand years ago a Roman citizen could walk across the face of the known world free of the fear of molestation? He could walk across the earth unharmed, cloaked only in the words 'Civis Romanis' I am a Roman citizen. So great was the retribution of Rome, universally understood as certain, should any harm befall even one of its citizens. Where was Morris' protection, or anyone else on that plane? Where is the retribution for the families and where is the warning to the rest of the world that Americans shall walk this earth unharmed, lest the clenched fist of the most mighty military force in the history of mankind comes crashing down on your house!? In other words, Leo, what the hell are we doing here?
Well our behavior has produced some pretty crappy results. In fact, I'm not a hundred percent sure it hasn't induced them.
I'm talking about two hundred and eight-six American marines in Beirut, I'm talking about Somalia, I'm talking about Nairobi.
You're damn right.
He had a ten-day-old baby at home.
We are doing nothing. They dest…
And this is good?
Which they'll rebuild again in six months.
Why didn't you say so? [beat] Oh man Leo. When I think of all the work you put in to get me to run. [both sit] When I think of all the work you did to get me elected. I could pommel your ass with a baseball bat.
Oh, I like anything that starts with 'Bertram Coles'. Let's have it.
Bert's calling me out?
Ziegler must be ballistic.
Oh, by the way, who was that kid before? The one who figured out where my glasses are?
What's his story?
[appears in the doorway] Excuse me Charlie. Can I see you inside please? Come on, it's okay.
But you prefer Charlie, right? Listen, Leo McGarry filled me in on the situation with your mother, I'm so very sorry. I hope you don't mind but I took the liberty of calling Tom Connolly, the FBI Director. We had the computer spit out some quick information, you're mother was killed by a Western .38 Revolver firing K.T.W.s, or what are known as 'Cop Killer bullets', now we have not had a whole lot of success banning that weapon and those bullets off the streets, but we're planning on taking a big whack at it when Congress gets back from recess. So, what do you say, you wanna come help us out?
Thanks.
You tell me.
My granddaughter gave me this tie.
Get away from me. Somebody throw this guy out of the building!
My fellow Americans, good evening. A short while ago I ordered our Armed Forces to attack and destroy four military targets in Northern Syria, this in response to the unwarranted, unprovoked…
…and cold-blooded downing three days ago of an unarmed Air Force jet carrying 58 passengers and the flag of the United States.
