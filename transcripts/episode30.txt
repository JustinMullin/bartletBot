Ah!
Yes, yes! Indeed I do.
Chef's choice. Twice the amount of carbon, which means it'll hold a sharp edge up to ten times longer and you can see the handle which texturized molded polymer has no rivets or air pockets.
This is an American knife.
No German knives for us.
Good job.
Hold on.
Nah… Nah. No, the balance isn't right.
Yeah. You know what we need?
Yeah.
You tell him they already briefed me on San Diego.
Okay.
The German's know how to make a knife, Charlie!
[to Toby] Josephine McGarry?
She's a controversial woman.
It is when it's a recess appointment. A recess appointment assumes the Senate's gonna have no problem with the nominee. The Senate is going to have a considerable problem with this nominee.
Toby…
Yes, I do.
I got to say… look, I'm just… Toby, I'm not wild about the woman. I've known her for 25 years and I think she's all about Eve.
Yeah.
Recess appointments.
Hey Leo…
Josey.
Assistant Secretary for Primary and Secondary Education.
We want the debate.
She did not call me.
Not patronate, yet she's qualified.
[to Toby] Take the meetings.
[to Josh and Sam] Yeah?
What?
You're kidding me.
You're kidding me!
Yeah.
Yeah?
[looks up] What am I doing?
Okay.
Excellent. [comes around his desk]
[takes the knife] The Missermeister. Meridian 3000 series. One-piece forged blade, riveted palm handle.
I don't like the handles.
How's it going?
You met with Chinese embassy officials?
Christians aren't persecuted in China. Since they aren't oppressed, they don't qualify for refugee status.
It's a fair point.
Yeah. They'll be coached.
Do you guys know what a "shibboleth" is?
It's from the Bible. "Then said now unto him, say now 'shibboleth" and he said "sibboleth" for he could not frame to pronounce it right." It was a password, the way the army used to distinguish true Israelites from impostors sent across the river Jordan by the enemy.
I'm having one of the Chinese refugees flown here. I'll meet with him tonight.
Yep.
I'm going to ask him to say "Shibboleth."
Is he here?
Good.
He speaks English. He's a chemistry professor.
[puts on his jacket] There was a while there I wanted to be a chemistry professor.
I never actually studied chemistry.
Yeah.
Jhin-Wei?
I'm Jed Bartlet. This is Leo McGarry.
Thanks for coming all this way.
Would you care to sit down? It's perfectly all right.
[motions to the table] There are some sandwiches here. If you get hungry, feel free to eat as much as you want.
There are questions as to the veracity of your claim to the asylum.
How did you become a Christian?
How do you practice?
Who's the head of your church?
Can you name any of Jesus' disciples? [beat] If you can't, that's okay. I usually can't remember the names of my kids, or for that matter…
[beat] Yes, it is. And you sir, just said the magic word in more ways than one. Thank you. [They stand.] It was a pleasure to meet you.
Right.
We don't have to grant asylum.
Where are they?
Not the Coast Guard?
Before… when it happened before… how did it work?
[beat] Mrs. Landingham?
I need to talk to the Governor of California.
Mrs. Landingham, can I look at a copy of the Thanksgiving proclamation?
'Cause…
I was standing at the door.
[starts to approach] Can I look at a copy…?
What you got, Charles?
Lighter weight blade.
I once test-drove the Komin Yomada.
Not wild about it--How about this?
Because it's something we pass on. Something with a history so we can say, 'My father gave this to me. His father gave it to him, and now I'm giving it to you.'
I do have one.
I'm giving mine away.
Whom.
Funny you should ask.
Charlie, my father gave this to me, and his father gave it to him, and now I'm giving it to you.
Take a look.
The fully tapered bolster allows for sharpening the entire edge of the blade.
Yeah. This was made for my family by a Boston silversmith named Paul Revere.
I'm proud of you, Charlie.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Hi.
Not too late to stop yourself.
I already pardoned a turkey.
Didn't I do it right?
Aren't I gonna get a reputation for being soft on turkeys?
No, I'm not just gonna get this--What the hell is going on?
If the Oscars were like that, I'd watch.
Just buy the second turkey.
There's not much I can do.
The turkey hasn't committed a crime.
C.J., I have really no judicial jurisdiction over birds.
Who's Morton…?
He's in high school and he doesn't know I can't pardon his turkey?
C.J., if we don't and I mean completely overhaul public education in this country…
Where the hell is he?
Hey, Morton.
Well said. Is that the turkey?
[to the turkey] You're pardoned.
What do you want?
[to the turkey again] By the power vested in me by the Constitution of the United States, I hereby pardon you.
No, it's not okay.
Morton, I can't pardon a turkey. If you think I can pardon a turkey, then you have got to go back to your school and insist that you be better prepared to go out in the world.
[beat] No. I tell you what I can do. I'm drafting this turkey into military service. In the meantime, somebody will be drafting a check, which will have my signature on it, so the folks can buy themselves a Butterball.
[quietly to C.J.] What's wrong with him?
[to Sam] I'm still waiting for the thing.
Let's go in.
Give me two minutes.
By the way, the Latin word for 'yam' is 'dioscorea.'
About the Chinese refugees?
Yeah. Can you believe it?
That detention center was being guarded by the 22nd Division of the California National Guard. Now, what does it say about our reserve army?
Let me read this.
'Well over three and a half centuries ago, strengthened by faith and bound by a common desire for liberty, a small band of pilgrims sought out a place in the New World where they could worship according to their own beliefs. Now therefore I, Josiah Bartlet, President of the United States, by virtue of authority and laws vested in me, do hereby proclaim this to be a National Day of Thanksgiving.'
[taking off his glasses] And call in the Red Cross. We didn't do anything illegal. We're not involved in any massive criminal conspiracy. There's no way I was letting them go, and we needed to help China save face, so now they can tell their people that the mighty American military was overpowered by…
You think I would've sent him back if he'd failed catechism? Let me tell you something. We can be the world's policeman. We can be the world's bank, the world's factory, the world's farm. What does it mean if we're not also…
We've made it into the New World, Josh. You know what I get to do now? I get to proclaim the National Day of Thanksgiving.
[to Josh] This is a great job.
