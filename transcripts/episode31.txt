Galileo V.
Just the name…
You can feel the adventure.
NASA's great at naming things.
Mercury, Apollo, Atlantis, the Sea of Tranquility, the Ocean of Storms…
First time I heard 'Galileo V,' the way the imagination immediately… It reminded me of the way folks in my generation felt when we heard "Yellow Submarine."
We really did all want to live in a yellow submarine.
Tell me where we're going again.
Why?
Say the name.
Say it again. Your imagination, like a child, will explode with unrestrained possibilities for adventure.
You didn't say it right.
Say it again.
Good morning!
How you doing?
Yes.
I know.
Yes.
We have questions in advance?
Katie, sixth grade, Green Oaks Junior High School, Austin, Texas, asks, "How old is the planet Mars?" That's a great question, Katie. The planet Mars is 4.6 billion years old.
I knew that one.
Yes, God forbid, that while talking to 60,000 public school students, the President should appear smart!
I don't show off. [reads again] Stevie, fourth grader, PS 31, Manhattan, asks, "What is the temperature on Mars?" Well, Stevie, if one of our expert panelists were here, they would tell you the average temperature ranges from 15 degrees to minus 140.
I converted it to Celsius in my head.
Can I see the intro?
[reads] "Good morning! I'm speaking to you live from the West Wing of the White House. Today we have a very unique opportunity to take part live in an extremely historic event which…" Whoa, boy…
Who wrote this intro?
[gets up and shakes his hand] Scott. "Unique" means "one of a kind." Something can't be very unique, nor can it be extremely historic.
Sam?
[to Tate] He's gonna make some changes.
[taps C.J. on the arm] He said it right.
Yeah. What else?
Okay, but then, let's bring the curtain down. I got a great night planned. I got two books on Mars and one on Galileo himself. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read.
[calls] Mrs. Landingham! [approaches Mrs. Landingham's desk]
Nothing after 6:30. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read about Mars, which while colder and drier, has four Earth-like seasons.
It does!
Since when?
Get me Leo!
To a concert?
Did Buddy Holly come back?
The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra?
[yelling] Leo!
I know where Reykjavik is, Charlie. I wish I was there right now.
The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra?
Why do I…?
I'm being punished.
Is this a joke?
Which we did, by canceling the meeting yesterday.
So to make up for it, I'm going to see the Reykjavik Symphony.
With, uh, Ambassador…
Okay.
I'll give you a thousand dollars if you don't make me go.
Do they vote?
Yeah.
Send them in.
Why?
Ah.
Hey, Jack. Charlie.
Gentlemen, please.
There was an explosion?
What's the problem Jack?
It's not a refinery fire?
There was an explosion in a missile silo?
If a missile exploded, is it possible it was armed? Was there a warhead?
Thank you.
Did they really think we weren't gonna see it, Leo?
If they asked, we could help.
Yeah. Yeah. Galileo Galilei. He sat in a cathedral in Pisa. He watched a lamp suspended from the ceiling as it oscillated back and forth. He used his pulse to keep time and discovered that the period of oscillation was independent of the size of the arc. A few years later he contradicted the theory that a heavier body falls faster than a lighter one. Which took some guts back in 1609, when you consider that the theory he was contradicting was Aristotle's.
[calls] Charlie! [to Leo] I really do. Have Sam and C.J. come along tonight.
Thanks.
He contradicted Aristotle, Charlie.
Yes, he did.
Yes. What's next?
What do you think happened?
Where are we with the Russian ambassador?
Leo, I want you to see her as soon as she can get here. Thank you everybody.
Leo?
We lost the signal from Galileo.
Do you know what they're playing?
The Reykjavik Symphony. Do we know what they're playing and for how long they're playing it?
Turn the car around.
Turn the car around.
Modern music sucks. Anything written after 1860 sucks.
Sucks.
Sucks.
Totally blows.
Played on teapots and gefilte fish.
If he wants more time, I'd be happy to take a rain check.
This is not classical music. It is not classical music if the guy finished writing it this afternoon.
C.J.!
A broader theme.
I don't get that many opportunities to talk with kids.
Yeah, but let's let 'em work for a while.
Where's Sam?
Why is he hiding from Mallory?
Not at all.
I took trombone lessons when I was a kid. Not much solo music written for the trombone, but I wanted to play in the marching band.
The thing was my arms were too short to reach seventh position.
One afternoon, during the game, I gave it all I had and ended up throwing the slide into the end zone, which is more than I can say for our quarterback.
Would you excuse me just one moment?
Galileo?
Yeah, what?
[pauses and sighs] Okay. [beat] What about Galileo?
Okay.
Yeah. [beat] Somebody was draining hydrogen?
Yeah?
Thanks.
[to Nadia] Your paranoia was a lot sexier back when you guys are communists.
From where do you get the nerve and try to dictate terms on this? Are you insane? Your missile regimen is in a horrifying state of disrepair. Your best-trained operators have left or died. The ones you've got aren't paid very much when they're paid at all. They don't have enough to train with. Your ICBMs are well behind their warranty life. Not seven weeks ago, you mistook a Norwegian weather rocket for a submarine launch Trident missile because the CrossTac information never made it to the Russian C&C system. [looks at Leo] Leo, at the time the S.S.19 exploded, it was being drained of its liquid hydrogen in an attempt by deserting soldiers to -- wait for it --
Steal the warhead! [beat] When were you gonna tell us about that? You realize how dangerous…
Well, I am concerned with the welfare of the Russian people, but that's not what they pay me for. You guys fall asleep in the switch in Minsk, and I've got a whole hemisphere hiding under the bed. How do you not tell us this is going on? How do you not ask us for help?
Yeah, thanks. We're sending in NATO inspectors.
Get your Foreign Minister on the phone.
I really don't know from where you guys get the nerve.
This is still my office, right?
Nothing new from NASA?
Earth's giving it instructions?
Like my kids. All right…
Green beans?
Yeah, okay. What about the stamp?
What?
All right. Everybody go away. We'll call you back when there's a NASA update.
C.J.?
Did you hear the end of the concert?
Well, first of all, let's not kid ourselves. The Reykjavik Symphony can play. These guys have some serious game. In this particular case, their talents were tragically misapplied to an atonal nightmare of pretention, but after intermission…
They played a piece by a new composer. First, I wasn't hearing it. I had 19 different things on my mind, but then I did, and C.J., it was magnificent. It was genius. He built these themes, and at the beginning, it was just an intellectual exercise, which is fun enough, I guess, but then in the fourth movement, he just let it go. I really didn't think I could be surprised by music anymore. I thought about all the times this guy must've heard that his music was no good… I've got to write this guy a letter.
I'm gonna wait up for a while. See if we hear anything. It's out there somewhere… It's so close.
Yeah?
I'll say.
C.J.?
You said it right that time.
Talk to us.
