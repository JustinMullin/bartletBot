What's going on? Sit down.
What does that mean?
Is he in there alone? Is there a crew?
Did he crash?
Is there any chance he's trying to contact the ground and can't?
Is his intention to defect with a military asset or his intention to blow something up?
Don't our fighter pilors have to go through some kind of psychological testing?
Let me ask a ridiculous question and I know the answer is no. Is there any way to bring this plane down without shooting it down?
What about populated areas?
Yeah okay.
They're going to know when the F-16's have painted him before I will.
Thank you.
When I was in tenth grade me and my friends took my dad's Ford Country Squire for a joyride to Vermont. He locked me in the garage till Easter.
What do you think we should do with this pilot once we get his ass on the ground?
[sadly] No.
What about them?
I'm gonna sign them all by hand.
I'm gonna sign them all by hand.
I don't like the whole idea of the autopen.
Let's do them all by hand. How many can there be?
How many am I sending out?
Seriously?
I'm sending out 1.1 million Christmas cards? [sits down]
Who are the other million?
I do?
Okay, but some of those were death threats.
Well, I'm not signing 1.1 million cards.
1.1 million cards?
[to Leo] Yeah?
What happened?
OPEC will find a way to punish us.
If the Saudis are that concerned, why don't they just make the old faster?
I didn't think so.
Let's set up a meeting.
You sold me. We're setting up a meeting. [about to walk out of the office]
[stops and turns to Josh] Why?
Well, I'm just talking about a meeting, but if I decide to do it, the President controls the SPR and not Congress.
The two aren't related.
How?
I'm saying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and forgiving the IMF debt are not related.
We'll talk to him tonight.
At the Christmas party, we'll take him asideâ€¦
Josh, Didion's a good guy, we can talk to him.
We'll talk with Didion tonight?
By the way, it's not intervention in a free market if that's what he's worried about.
It's not free trade if the price of oil is being controlled by a cartel.
Sam, you'll be in on this?
Thank you.
You look good, Charlie.
I've brought it back.
Like Woodrow Wilson and top hats.
No. Thank you.
Charlie, this is how Statesmen dress. This is how they dress in times of occasion.
It's regal.
