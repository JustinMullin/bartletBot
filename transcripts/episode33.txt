What?!
What's after that?
After that?
Who was the idiot who set off the smoke detector?
They had me on the Truman balcony for 6 minutes in my underwear.
In January? No. Why do you ask?
We're having Vermont maple syrup?
I don't give a damn if they call it the Monroe doctrine. What the hell are we doing serving Vermont maple syrup?
New Hampshire syrup is what we serve in this White House.
It's a breakfast. We eat. We pose for pictures. You do a post-game conference. Everybody gets the hell out of here and I don't have to be so Officer Crupky.
Thank you.
Charlie!
Who's the next meeting?
I don't need a cheat sheet. [takes his glasses off] Kim Woo, he won a bronze medial for fencing, he's a Buddhist, and he enjoys European History. You see Charles's even thought it's a handshake, I'm able to make him feel like a friend and that's a little thing they call 'people skills.'
The man's an Olympic athlete, Charlie. I wouldn't say that to his face.
What else?
on glasses, reads] Ladies and Gentleman. [beat] That's funny. [pause, while he reads] Yeah, that's funny. [laughs, to Charlie] She's a woman?
Did you mark that down?
[reads the speech] "We spend so much time demonizing the other side, treating our opponents as if they were strangers with which we share nothing in common that we've lost sight perhaps of the greater truths." [beat, to Charlie] Did you know it's bad luck to toast with water?
Yeah, you don't want to make a toast with water.
From Greek mythology, I'm almost sure. You lose your spirit. [reads again]
[continues reading] Hmm?
That's a great question, Charlie, and I could tell you, but I think it's better if you look it up on your own.
[reads] "That we lost sight of the greater truths. There's a lot more that unites Americans than divides them." That's good. "There's a lot more that unites Americans than divides them." [stands up] Remind me to tell Sam that's good.
And remind me not to make a toast with water.
Ah. Let's goâ€¦
I think the whole damn thing is bizarre.
The right moment for what?
Well, I'm not sure there is a right moment for you to ask me that, Charlie.
Yeah.
Donna wants me to call Karen Cahill and make it clear she wasn't hitting on her when she gave her her underwear.
There can't possibly be nuclear weapons in Kyrgyzstan.
Okay. Yeah.
[shaking his head] I'm going to bed. If anybody thinks of new ways for us to make friends don't hesitate to wake me. Or, you know, just feel free to start a fire.
Good night.
