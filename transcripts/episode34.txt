Mr. Sumatra, I understand you're a sports fan.
Okay. Well, golf's not a sport. It's fine. Don't get me wrong but let's not you and I confuse it with things that men do.
You know, we're going to Bangkok in June, I think. [to Charlie] June, Charlie?
Best hotel in the world, right?
Is that right?
[to Charlie] Make sure I see that.
[to diplomatic aide] Tom?
Mr. Sumatra, I accept your letter of credence from King Adulyadej and by affixing my signature and seal, [signs the paper] do hereby declare you to be an ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. [Sumatra bows and accepts the credentials back.] May our people know peace and prosperity. [They shake hands.] Congratulations.
We've some gifts here and we're going to stand for pictures.
[to Mrs. Sumatra] Madam, congratulations.
[enters from Oval Office] What's up?
And I'm sure someone will come along soon thereafter and tell it didn't work.
Cause it's not going to work.
What do you get?
Well, I can't make you Thailand's ambassador to the United States because I just signed that guy's letter. [points to Oval Office]
You know what you are? You are the Charlie Brown of missile defense. The Pentagon is Lucy.
Peanuts. Charlie Brown.
Why?
Leo, were you born at age 55?
Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football and Lucy would hold it, except she'd pull it away at the last minute and Charlie Brown would fall on his butt.
No, but each time Lucy would find a way to convince Charlie Brown that this time she wouldn't pull the ball away. But she would and, once again, Charlie Brown would fall on his butt.
Its' satirical.
The DOD bringing you to the Situation Room every time they run a new missile test so that you come to me and tell me how great it works so I'll put money in the NMD system.
It doesn't work.
Hey, where are we?
And it's going to hit my garage in New Hampshire when?
So what happens now?
Where?
Okay, but we don't have anybody out there right now do we?
When we stay at the Oriental in Bangkok, we have to check out Michener's typewriter.
Is that silence a pretty good sign?
It was just enthusiastic.
When you consider the size of outer space, Leo, that's not so bad.
By the way, the words you're looking for are "Oh good grief." [walks out]
I think a lot of people don't realize that Swedes have lived in Sweden more than 5,000 years longer than nearly any other European people.
In fact, Gothic tribes from Sweden played a major role in the disintegration of the Roman Empire, did they not?
So you've got that to answer for!
[puts his eyeglasses on] Mr. Hans, I accept your letter of credence from king Gustav, and, by affixing my signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. [returns the papers]
Congratulations. [They shake hands.]
Sweden has a 100% literacy rate, Leo, a hundred percent! How do they do that?
Maybe.
Yes?
The tenth being?
[with sarcasm] Damn!
So close.
That tenth one! See, if there were just nine…
Leo, seriously, when they were telling you that on the phone, how stupid did you think you'd sound saying that to me?
It doesn't work.
Do we have to decide this right now?
Okay.
[putting his glasses on and reading] Yeah?
How?
For example?
And we can't take it for granted that everyone pretty much fundamentally opposes arson?
It would be hypocrisy not to hold our friends to the same standard…
Yet it feels strange to score political points by doing the right thin.
[gruffly] I'm victim to my own purity of character.
Okay, well, it's not a kind of a possum, so why don't you get me that information. Toby doesn't want it in the speech?
Did you hear?
Ain't it great?
Absolutely.
No.
[shouts after him] 2,000 environmentalists are going to try and kill me tomorrow night!
They're going to come at me with vegan food and pitchforks!
Still, I'd like you to get between me and any boiled seaweed you see coming my way.
Leo has just talked to me.
Yeah, I'm not doing this for the politics, I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do.
A lynx isn't a possum.
It's a cat.
How did Sam feel about this? [beat] Toby?
I'm not going to tell you how to run your office, Toby.
[beat, resumes walking] Vegan food. Coming at me all night long.
[walks in with Josh and Charlie] John!
[shakes his hand] It's good to have you here.
What made you decide to take the post?
Listen, I gotta go a few blocks across town to give an address on global warming and the future of our planet. That's not something you're interested in, right?
Okay. Well, stay here and fight with Leo about something. We'll get you some dinner. I'll be back in an hour. We'll do your thing and then enjoy your reception.
That was Chairwoman Shelly Lubis I just got off the phone with. Before that was a conference call with Jamie Schwartz of the Environmental Defense Fund, Bryce Davis of the Sierra Club, and three Democratic Congressman from the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. The number of different words they had for "manipulative,"
I said for fifty bucks and a ride to the airport, Gillette could have the job right now.
I politely reminded him that it's probably not a good idea to threaten the president. [yelling] Nancy! [to Leo] I want to know when you're pushing me towards the missile shield it's not because you want me to look strong on defense.
Would you tell Charlie I'm ready?
Based on what?
It's almost hard to believe that you're not on the National Security Council.
John! Let me explain why you've been waiting. I have to see people in the order they arrive, and you got beat by Argentina.
You also lost out on preferred seating for the State of the Union.
Yes!
Okay, Tom?
Where are you on the missile shield?
Leo?
Well, it's a discussion for serious men. They say a statesman is a politician who's been dead for fifteen years. I'd like us to be statesmen while we're still alive. Lord Marbury, I accept your letter of credence from Queen Elizabeth, and, by affixing my signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.
Let's go.
