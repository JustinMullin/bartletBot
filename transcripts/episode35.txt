Where are we?
Bob Novak just said this was the speech of my political life. You know how many times I've heard that?
Do it.
Good.
Abbey's already in her seat?
[to Charlie] I said, my wife's in her seat?
Do it.
Yeah.
The Blue Ribbon…
Yeah.
[nodding] Yeah
Thanks.
[crossing himself] Amen.
Mr. Finney, would you tell the Speaker I'd like to see him please?
How's it going? [They shake hands.]
I heard.
[to staffer] Thank you. [to Sam] Listen you scored big on some of the stuff I fought you on. [acknowledges staffers as they walk by]
Repay you for what?
[waves] I owe you money for that?
I owe you anything for that?
[waving] Thank you.
Don't you already get paid?
[to Charlie] Hang on. [to Sam] Is there anything in particular you'd like me to say?
[smiling] That's really good.
Yeah.
What's going on with the police officer?
We're going to get knocked off the story by a…
What is?
They can be identified as drug agents?
Yeah, they may have blown their cover.
Mickey, how do we know they're still alive?
And they kill our guys unless Santos releases Juan Aguilar from a prison in Bogot..
Why not?
Robbie…
How long?
How many Affronte casualties?
[shaking head] No.
You think we're headed for Vietnam?
How?
How long is it going to take Special Forces to mobilize?
[looks at his watch] Well then, I want our people to keep talking to Nelson Guerra. But in three hours in want to be ready to kick in the back door.
Leo, I'd like the Senior Staff. Would you round them up?
[to Leo] I'll be wandering the halls.
[casually] What's up?
I never even knew we HAD a nightclub down here.
Yeah. Ainsley, I wanted to say hello and to you know… mention "a lot of people assumed you were hired because you're a blonde, republican sex kitten" and well, they're obviously wrong. Keep up the good work.
[to Sam] You know we're meeting?
Hey.
They said you were in here.
[looks over at the kitchen staff] Fellas…
You're mad at me.
Abbey, so I indicated we were open to new ideas. How did I fail you this time?
I have a meeting. [turns and starts to walk out]
[turns back] Things had to be cut.
To make a 90 minutes speech into an 80 minutes speech things had to go.
Abbey.
Right now…
Abbey.
[looks at her with surprise] That's not what tonight's…
That was three years ago.
I have Special Forces headed to Columbia on ready alert. They're waiting for an order in a little less than hours.
Affronte took five DEA Agents hostage in Puente Mayo…
Yeah?
I'll be right there.
Abbey…
All right. [sighs] I've got to go.
