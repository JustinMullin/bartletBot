It was just three hours ago I gave the State of the Union.
Do you believe that?
I'm not allowed to smoke inside anymore.
Up to the point where you accidentally burn holes in priceless antiques.
Why?
I smoke two cigarettes a day.
For who… Russian spy satellites? [points up] George Bernard Shaw says, "You don't live longer, it just seems longer."
I'm not sure it was either. [looks at his watch] Is it time?
Where are we? Everyone sits.
Tell me what happens when I give the order
What'll they do when they get there?
Why?
Nineteen guys are going to have to lay face down in the jungle until sunset?
They're moving the hostages from where to where?
Code name's Cassiopeia.
Mickey, you look like you want to say something.
Are we going to keep them alive longer, or is it just going to seem longer?
I've been given reason to believe they'll be tortured at Villa Cerreno. They're U.S. drug agents. They know things these people want to know.
Go.
Yeah?
This isn't cold. It's crisp.
Well you're a big wussie.
It'll leave the Bishop open.
Where?
Abbey's pretty pissed at me.
Pretty bad.
You know I have this image in my mind of the dead soldiers coming back from Vietnam… the caskets coming off the plane. I don't know from where.
[surprised] Caskets coming off the plane?
Are they down?
Where they'll wait.
I'll see you in the morning.
Hey.
Thanks for having breakfast with me.
Did you order something?
[loudly] Billy! [to Josh and Sam] You want scrambled eggs?
Could we get these guys some scrambled eggs?
No, I'm fine.
No!
Bring them some food, would ya?
You guys understand I can't discuss with you any rescue mission that may or may not be in play right now?
Nelson Guerra wants me to tell President Santos to release Juan Aguilar from prison.
I have a gun to my head and I'm not making that phone call. I inherited the war on drugs from a President, who inherited it from a President, who inherited it from a President before that. I'm not a hundred percent sure who we're fighting but I'm sure we're not winning. Ten years ago we spent $5 billion fighting drugs and we did such a good job that last year we spent $16 billion. Sixty percent of Federal prisoners are in jail on drug charges as opposed to two and a half percent in jail for violent crime. We imprison a higher percentage of our citizens than Russia did under Communism and South Africa under Apartheid. Somewhere between fifty and eighty-five percent of our prison population has a drug or alcohol abuse problem. We've tried "just say no." I don't think it's going to work. [looks at his watch] I'm mentioning this because I'd like you to give me any thoughts you might have on the subject.
[to Charlie] Hey.
[to Abbey] What was that about?
Packing already?
You aren't leaving till tonight, right?
Men and women are completely different in this regard.
I don't know. I just had breakfast with Sam and Josh. Toby's having breakfast with Seth Gillette, who's every bit as pissed at me as you are.
Abbey, can we…
We didn't get a chance to talk again last night.
Talk?
Ever?
Look…
Why?
[angry] I can do two things at once. [throws up his hands]
[shouting] Yes and I'd like to go about my day without this black cloud around me so I'd like to talk now!
[shouting] What are you, my Zen master? Can I be in charge of my own mind?!
[mumbles] I feel better already.
[enters] Hey.
Is she here?
Yeah.
Where is she?
Why?
Why is she still in there?
Why don't we get her out here?
Ainsley, why don't come on out of there…
How you doing? We met last night. [shaking her hand] You were singing and dancing in a bathrobe.
Why were you in the closet?
They won't let me smoke inside but you can pee in Leo's closet.
I appreciate you coming to work for me, Ainsley. You're an exceptionally bright young woman. Is your father proud of you?
I bet he is. [pats her arm] Listen…
What happened?
Charlie, get the door.
What happened?
Did we lose the hostages?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?!
No…
How many guys were on the Blackhawk?
[angry] So I've got nine more guys now on the ground we've got to get back.
[to Leo] They're dead.
I want the President of Colombia on the phone. I want a translator in this room right now.
[shaking his fists] DAMMIT! [paces, obviously livid] DA…! [shaking his fists]
How the hell did that happen?
[shouting] YOU THINK!?
We've never anticipated the possibility that somebody might try that?
[gestures angrily] We weren't prepared for someone to try to outfox us with a stratagem so sophisticated it's an entire generation beyond "Hey look, your shoelaces are untied"!? [shouting] IS THAT HOW I JUST LOST NINE GUYS TO A DAMN STREET GANG WITH A HAM RADIO!?
[shouting] THEY LURED US THERE SO THAT THEY COULD KILL NINE [voice breaking] AMERICAN SOLDIERS!!!
Where are the bodies?
Where?
Is somebody translating on the other end?
[into phone] Mr. President, this is the President of the United States.
[into phone, looks at his watch] Mr. President, 90 minutes ago the United States invaded Columbian airspace. Two Blackhawk helicopters went into Tres Encinas with 20 Delta Commandos on intelligence that the hostages were being moved. One of the Blackhawks was shot down. They were nine military fatalities.
[into phone] I'd like to ask for your assistance in confirming that the five hostages are still alive.
[into phone] How do you know that?
[into phone] Yes?
[into phone] I'm not going to ask you, Miguel.
[into phone] Say that again.
[into phone,long pause] Well I appreciate your making that offer but I don't think that's a very good idea.
[into phone] Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.
Juan Aguilar runs one of the largest drug cartels in the world.
He has produced $15 billion worth of cocaine in two years.
He's murdered or ordered the murder of eight Supreme Court justices, a pro-extradition Prime Minister and three Federal police officers in Bogot.. And from his prison cell I guarantee you he orchestrated the kidnapping of five U.S. DEA agents and the killing of their rescuers!
I'm not letting him out. [slams shut his folder] I'll share a cell with him before I let him out. I want military options!
Do we know where they are?
What would it take to get them back?
Yeah.
What would it take to wipe them out?
Yeah. What would it take?
[surprised] Half?
[to Leo] You've really got to ask yourself what's the point in being a Super Power anymore.
[enters] And then there's the repack!
First there's the preliminary, or the dry run. Then there's the actual packing. [joking] Abbey, you're just going away for two days, right?
[seriously] Right?
It was an ambush.
A guy with a shoulder thing shot down a Blackhawk. Everybody's dead. [sits facing her] Nine guys. Meanwhile, they've moved the hostages 60 miles into the jungle where we'd need a pair of tweezers to get them out.
[shakes head] No.
No. I didn't make the decision to run again. I wouldn't do that without talking to you first.
When, Abbey?
I didn't make the decision to run again!
That's what we do, Abbey. We run for things! From the day a Congressman is sworn in he's got to raise $10,000 a week to get reelected! A President gets to govern for eighteen months. We try to get people to vote for us and in the process we hope the people force us to do good things.
[angry] Yes, we had a deal.
[scornfully] Abbey…
I've had one episode in two years.
[quietly] I know what it's going to…
Look…
[quietly] Yeah.
Have a good trip.
Call me when you get there.
I love you.
Hey, Charlie. You shouldn't be out here without a coat.
Yeah?
No. Thanks.
Hey!
Let me tell you something, Leo… [sits] After heroin and cocaine, tobacco is next.
Leo, I can't possibly reverse our…
I can't possibly reverse our position on negotiating…
There were just fourteen people in this room who heard Santos make me the offer.
You know what Truman Capote said was the bad part about living outside the law?
You no longer have the protection of it. What's to stop me? Two hundred CIA operatives… Black Ops. Two hundred guys with no wives, no kids, no parents. [faces Leo] I send 200 operatives down there. Monday morning I read in the paper Juan Aguilar is dead. What's to stop me?
It was the Queen's Rook. That's why I couldn't trade the Bishop. It was over six moves ago. Arrange for their immediate release.
[warning glare] If they so much as experience turbulence on their way out…
I want to go to Dover later tonight.
Thank you.
I'll call their families afterwards…
