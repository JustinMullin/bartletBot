They're trying to export their way out of their own economic problems.
And by dumping low priced steel on the U.S., you know what they're asking for?
They're begging for a protectionist response. Steel and mining employ a hundred and seventy thousand workers. They're not going to sit around while discount steel comes flying into… how you doing? [waves to someone calling "Welcome back, sir!"] They're going to want retaliatory tariffs, and you know what that means?
A return to Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.
Leo, I'm walking over to the press and telling them that retaliatory tariffs are gonna cost American taxpayers eight hundred thousand dollars for every job saved.
What's going on?
Eleanor?
You mean Zoey.
When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me six hours ago?
[angry] Thank you. I've had it, C.J. I've absolutely had it!
What the hell is Danny Concannon doing calling to my kid?
He knows better than that! They all know better than that! But Danny…
C.J., you're going to suspend his credentials for six months, and I don't give a damn. His paper wants to cover the President, they can send someone else.
I was told it was Danny.
[pause] She called him?
The Allman Brothers, Josh?
Tokyo is willing to show economic restraint, in exchange for a good fielding shortstop and a left-handed reliever… Who's against us so far?
Appropriations?
Who's coming to her defense?
Yeah?
Yes, I understand I've been congratulated for denouncing a movie I've never heard of.
I've got to hand it to you guys you've pulled off a political first. You've managed to win me the support of the Christian Right and the Cheech and Chong Fan Club in the same day.
Anything else?
Thank you.
Charlie? Would you arrange for my middle daughter to come see me at her earliest possible convenience?
Ah, screw her convenience. Get her ass down here.
…in consumer costs per job saved. Retaliatory tariffs on steel imports are a disaster. Anyone wants to check my math, they're more than welcome to.
Anybody wants to shove the Golden Gate Bridge up Japan's ass, they're more than welcome to do that too.
Oh… [turns to advisors] Thank you.
Ellie, thanks for coming.
Come on in.
Did you get down here Okay?
Did you take an airplane?
A helicopter?
That's because you go to school at Johns Hopkins, right?
And Johns Hopkins is in Baltimore. I'm asking 'cause Baltimore is a 45-minute car ride from Washington, D.C. and we hardly see you anymore. So, I thought either you transfered to a different medical school, they moved Johns Hopkins, or they moved Baltimore. Are any of those things true?
Okay. And this is accurate, right? This quote "My father won't fire the Surgeon General. He would never do that."
Elanor, when you put your head down, your hair falls in your face, and I can't see your face, and I can't hear what you're saying. Now look at me, and talk to me.
What the hell are you doing talking to a reporter?
[getting angry] I have set up monumental, unprecedented, unbreakable rules about my children and the press. I have gotten White House reporters transferred to Yemen for approaching Zoey and Elizabeth. It is the law! [walks away to calm down] Well, I'm sure before you gave the quote you cleared it with the Communications Office. I'm sure you went over the exact wording with C.J. Cregg and coordinated with White House strategy so that the timing was right in the news cycle. I'm certain you consulted the appropriate party leadership because you're a pretty knowledgeable operative having spent so much time with me. Ellie?
What?
WHAT?
Pick your head up!
There is politics involved in this, Ellie. And you knew it would make me unhappy and that's why you did it and that's cheap.
Well, you sure didn't do it to make me happy!
Okay, let's drop it.
Mom gets back first thing in the morning and we're running a movie tonight if you want to stay over.
Yeah, thanks.
That door over there. [points]
Yeah.
Send him in. [beat] Charlie… Give me just a minute, would you?
Good evening.
I'm sorry about this.
Is that your resignation?
Thank you.
Did you not think that playing down the dangers of drug use sent a dangerous signal as well?
Millie, did you put her up to it?
"My father won't fire the Surgeon General, he would never do that." You didn't put her up to it?
You didn't pick up the phone after Josh came to see you and say, "Ellie, it's your godmother, let's stick it to your old man, and paint him into a corner?"
Why haven't I ever been able to get her to like me? I'm asking you.
I'm asking you.
I'm not.
She's mad at me.
Yes, I am!
I was running for President, where the hell was she?
Not like Zoey and Liz.
She's always belonged to Abbey.
No, I didn't!
How did I frighten her?
I was elected two years ago, she's 24 years old!
It never seemed to intimidate Zoey or Liz.
That's not true.
That's not true.
No, no, no. I will bear with the nonsense of the Christian right and the Hollywood left and the AFL-CIO and the AARP and the Canubus society and Japan, but I will not stand and allow someone to tell me that I love one of my children less than the others. [walks to the glass door] She's frightened of me?
I wanted to be so mad at her. I heard the news and my first thought was.. My god, "King Lear" is a good play. [sighs] "My father won't fire the Surgeon General, he would never do that." I wanted to be so mad at her. But the truth is, it's the nicest thing she's ever said about me.
Good night.
Hey, doc!
I don't accept it.
I don't accept your resignation.
These are the bigger things. I don't accept your resignation. [hands her the paper] You work for me. You go when I tell you to.
[walking out the glass door, turns] Yes, I know.
[from outside] Yes, indeed.
Tell
You know, Josh, I think if you ever have a daughter, you're going to discover there are worse reasons in the world to do something. Sit down, we're coming to the good part.
[to Ellie] How you doing?
I said, how you doing?
You know, we're coming up to the good part.
You want to bet me your tuition no one in this room is going to shush me?
I hear you're thinking about ophthalmology.
[not looking at her either] Why would you want to study people's feet?
That's children's medicine.
I thought it was obstetrics.
And what's the study of feet?
Hmmm? [beat, while he looks at her gently] The only thing you ever had to do to make me happy was come home at the end of the day.
So, endocrinology would be what? Disorders of the gallbladder?
I'm pretty sure you're wrong about that, I think endocrinology is your sub-specialty of internal medicine, devoted to the digestive system.
Are you sure it's not nephrology, immunology, cardiology, or dermatology?
Okay. Here comes the good part.
