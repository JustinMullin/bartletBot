I don't really need to see the ten-year numbers.
Have the ten-year projections ever been close to accurate?
Within a trillion dollars.
Okay. Bring me the ten-year projection, a Ouiji board and a magic wand.
What's next?
From whom?
That name sounds familiar.
Yes. I remember being locked in a steamer trunk.

We lost the site.
Why?
Which says?
What plaid flannel-wearing, cheese-eating, yahoo of a milkman governor signed that idiot bill into state law? [beat, while Charlie keeps his eyes down] It was me, wasn't it?
Okay.
Yeah, go ahead.
No.
No, don't go ahead with the site. I justâ€¦ [sighs] Tell my brother to hang on, would you? I'll make a decision. I don't know what the damn hurry is.
Charlie?
Let's do calls in the residence, okay?
I think there were a couple of late memos.
Thanks.
I'm going to head home.
I'll make calls from the residence.
Yeah.
Well, there's this wooded land on the Connecticut River, but the Abenaki Indians are claiming it's an ancient burial ground.

This is how long I get before I have to start with the library? Two years? And the first six months was figuring out how to work the phones? Oh, by the way, they've changed the phones again.
This is the last job I've ever going to have. This is the last time I'm going to come to work with people. I swear to God, I feel like I was just starting to get good at it.
Not yet, okay?
I'll see you tomorrow.
