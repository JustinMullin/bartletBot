Leo.
You busy?
Come have dinner with me.
Pierre Boileau is cooking tonight. You want to have dinner?
That's your answer?
Well, I can tell you that the man specializes in a reinterpretation of classic Provancale cuisine. Cassoulet, duck with green olives…
…saffron chicken…
Well, don't you think you deserve one?
His specialty is his dessert: Tomate de Saltambique.
Passion fruit, kiwi and hazelnuts, and…
Let's go. Leave the cell phone.
We're not leaving the building. People can find you.
What's he on to now?
Oh, brother.
Could Howard Stackhouse possibly be a bigger horse's patoot?
He's a curmudgeon: a grouchy old crank.
You are. I am full of mirth.
He was all over me the first year. He called me, "Bartlet the Inert."
I'm a reformer. I'm the most liberal President he's ever served under. His hero, Hubert Humphrey, once, you know…
That's right. [silence] I feel bad.
His wife died a few years ago. I didn't go to the funeral.
I was kind of busy running for President, Leo.
Tomate de Saltambique, my friend.
Hi. Hang on. [to Leo] They thought I was going to be eating with Abbey, so…
We'll just, you know, pretend there's no candlelight.
Yeah.
Leo, you have a deputy who's, frankly, a lot smarter than you are. Whatever it is, let him handle it. Who are you talking to?
What did he say?
Okay. Let's eat.
Nah, I'm fine.
No, she's up at the Manchester house.
No, it really sucks, but thanks.
Did you hear that? He said, "Very good, sir". Where do they learn that?
Nothing.
I just feel like we don't talk anymore.
See you're not even listing.
I'm just saying we work all day, and then the day's over, and we go out to dinner and you're still working, and you know, I'm sitting here. No time to talk.
No, it's not. (clears his throat)
I made…
I made a deal with Abbey… 'cause of my thing.
[nods] My thing, by the way, is the reason Hoynes stepped up on oil.
Yeah.
(sighs) Let's go.
How does he not just tell me?
How does he not come to me and say "Jed, this is my grandson and there are lots more like him and there are lots more to come. Can you help us out?"
Damn it. He knows we would have gotten it done. Why doesn't he tell me?
Nah, he's a crank.
Hey. Hey Donna, you need something?
C.J., that phone message was for real. He's not going to stop till he drops.
C.J., let me tell you something. Don't ever, ever underestimate the will of a grandfather. We're mad men. We don't give a damn. We got here before you and they'll be here after. We'll make enemies, we'll break laws, we'll break bones but you will not mess with the grandchildren.
C.J…. If I told you to screw the print deadline what would you want to do right now?
Give him some dignity right? And give him a rest. The guy's going to collapse out there.
Screw the print deadline. Leo?
We will talk about the other thing later.
Though it's not the worst idea in the world.
I was in the House. I know nothing about Senate rules.
What time is it? Let's wake up a parliamentarian.
We're going to get one of them to walk in there. Charlie!
I want to call Senators. We'll start with our friends. When we're done with those two, we'll go on to the other 98.
There's no damn holiday for us either.
C.J., no kidding, make this happen.
Trust me just this once, you grouchy old son of a bitch.
