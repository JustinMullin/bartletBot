One night he went in and set the briefcase down and said, 'Bess, why do you suppose it is that only sons-of-bitches know how to lick a stamp?' [laughter and applause] The point is, friends, you've got to write the letter, you've got to send a fax, you've got to pick up the phone and call Western Union. You've got to contact your Congressional representative…
You've got to say 'Mister, I've got a friend who's neighbor is dead…
'…Madam, I've got a neighbor whose friend is dead, whose husband is dead, whose mother is dead, kids are dead! Kids are dead!
'…and I wanna know, mister. I wanna know, madam…
…how you intend to vote on Wednesday, so that I'll know how to vote next election…'
You gotta ask 'em. You gotta ask 'em! [Applause. Josh joins Leo backstage.]
You know, I had a civil procedure professor who said once…
He said, 'When the law is on your side, argue the law; and when the facts are on your side, argue the facts…
…When you don't have the law on your side, when you don't have the facts on your side, bang your fist on the defense table as loud as you can.' Well, we've got the law on our side now, and we've got the facts on our side now…
…bang our fist on the defense table, but we're not listening any more. We're not having that any more. We're gonna win on Wednesday. We're gonna win on Wednesday! Thank you all. [The crowd stands up and applauds.] God bless you, and God bless America!
Thank you.
Thank you. Good night. [to Toby, in front of him] Toby!
What'd you think?
I thought you would.
Oh, you noticed that, did you?
Yes. I did a little polish right up there on my feet.
Right in front of everybody. I looked to the side at one point, you know. I half expected to see you coming at me with a salad fork.
Yup. Thank God for the secret service.
[sees a couple getting friendly in the hall] Hey there, fella. She deserves a nice room and some supper.
[smiles] Yeah. [Toby laughs.] Hey, Charlie!
What'd you think of the speech?
Yes, you.
I mean the entire speech, Charlie, and in particular the delivery.
See, I think what Charlie's trying to say is that in this case the singer outdistanced the song.
You know what, Toby?
You're what my mother calls a pain in the ass.
Yes, Charlie. By the way, did the First Lady call?
My back is fine.
Those damn things make me goofy.
You don't have to describe her tone to me, Charlie. I've been married to it for 32 years.
Give me the medicine, Charlie. [takes the medicine and sticks it in his pocket] Thank you. Have a good night. I'll see you in the morning.
[to the crowd] Thank you all.
Hey!
Oh, I feel fine.
Hmm?
Absolutely no need. I'm fine. What's going on here?
I like to… [mimes rolling sleeves] Roll up my sleeves and you know… [pause]
I don't mind telling you C.J. I was in a little pain there.
I wasn't supposed to take 'em both?
No no no. Sit sit sit.
One of you's got a problem and I'm here to help. You guys are like family. You've always been there for me, always been loyal. Honest, hard working, good people, and I love you all very much. I don't say that often enough. So tell me what the problem is, Toby. [puts his hand on Sam's knee]
Sam, of course you are.
Toby. [pause] Toby. Toby. Toby. [pause] Toby's a nice name, don't you think?
No, no, no, no. Please, Leo. I know my body. I mean, you know, my muscles are not, you know, but my mind is sharp. I can focus. I'm focused. You all know that about me. Here's what I think we ought to do… [long pause] Was I just saying something?
Hot damn! Now you're talking.
Ah.
Done.
Toby, you're a great writer, do you know that?
Here, give me a hug.
Come on. Give us a hug. [hugs Toby] There you go.
Charlie!
Charlie's a great name.
I'm going. I'm going. [gets up] Before I go, please let me just say this. [sighs] I'm seriously thinking about getting a dog.
Maybe an Irish setter, Charlie. What do you think?
