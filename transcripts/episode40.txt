I closed the embassies in Tanzania and Brussels.
I don't have to make that call yet.
About an hour.
Tell him what?
What happened?
Yeah…
He…
He scheduled a trip to New Hampshire?
Yeah, thanks to who?
To do what?
You think Toby's reaction is going to be the same as the public's?
Which will be?
[rising] The staff's reaction will be what?
What do I tell him?
Go tell him.
Now it starts.
Good evening, Toby. Can I fix you a drink?
Have a drink with me.
Bourbon and white.
You know what I found out recently? To be called bourbon, it has to come from Kentucky. Otherwise it's called sour mash. [pause] An Algerian-born terrorist named Redin Hassan was recently arrested at the Canadian border in a U-Haul carrying ten 2-ounce jars of nitroglycerin.
No. On advice from State and Intelligence, I've closed the embassies in Tanzania and Brussels.
They wanted me to heighten security, order the Air Force, but it's a holiday weekend. I don't know. Toby, I got to tell you something…
Yeah.
I don't know…
About an hour. Toby, about 10 years ago, for a period of a few months, I was feeling run down and had a pain in my leg. They both subsided, but 8 years ago, the pain came back, as well as numbness. My vision would become blurry and I'd feel dizzy. During an eye exam, the doctor detected abnormal pupil responses and ordered an MRI. The radiologist found plaque on my brain and spine. I have a relapsing-remitting course of MS.
I have Multiple Sclerosis.
I'm sorry?
It's… I don't know… it's the good kind of MS.
Yeah, as opposed to secondary progressive.
Yeah. MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms can be as mild as numbness or as severe as paralysis.
Yeah.
Yup.
No. That's the good news. The bad news is there's no cure.
Ever turn into secondary progressive?
Sure.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[enters] The plural of Surgeon General isn't Surgeon Generals, it's Surgeons General. Like Attorneys General, or courts martial. Nobody was asked to lie. That was Garreth from the FAA. Upon interrogating Reda Messam, they believe it's possible that another rental car crossed the border yesterday. They believe it's headed to a safe house in Patterson, New Jersey, and the FBI thinks they can apprehend him in 24 hours. Of course, the only way all of this will happen is if Reda Messam is telling the truth, so who wants odds? Anyway, they're still looking at forensic evidence and we're going to talk again in a few minutes to decide if there's a credible threat.
I said, we're going to decide if there's a credible threat. Why? What are you guys talking about?
[looks up] Hmm?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
An episode.
[sarcastically] I know. I can't believe we're all still here.
The episode was over. Leo was with me. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was with me as were the Secretaries of State and Defense.
I'm sorry?
I get injections of Betaseron.
From a doctor.
I think it would be best while temperature are running a little high if you refer to my wife as Mrs. Bartlet or the First Lady.
What you got, Leo?
The FAA?
Talk me through what heightened security means.
They discontinue…
Okay, they want a few minutes?
[sarcastic] Toby's concerned that the peaceful solution I brokered last year in Kashmir was the result of a drug induce haze.
I was elected, they were appointed. [points at Leo] The Vice President was elected. He has the constitutional authority to assume my…
That's because I never signed the letter and I don't think I got shot because I got MS.
And the walls came tumbling down. I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
[angry] No, Toby's concern for my health is moving me in ways…
[yelling] SHUT UP!
[condescending] You know your indignation would be a lot more interesting to me if it wasn't quite so covered in crap!
[while glaring at Toby] Yeah.
[acknowledges Charlie] Thanks.
[angry] Are you pissed because I didn't say anything or are you pissed because there were 15 people who knew before you did? I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
[into phone] Yeah, this is the President.
[leaning on a wing chair] Sorry about that.
Charlie! [to Leo] I've got to make the call.
Let's get Gareth back.
The scanners they use take an hour to search the luggage of 250 passengers. The condition requires two photo IDs. Most people only have one. Delays. Delays are the downside.
That timed out well.
[into phone] Hal? Okay, let's do it. I'm ordering the airports to a 2-condition. You'll have it in writing in about five minutes. Thanks. [hangs up, to Leo] I didn't know enough.
[calmly] I have no intention of apologizing to you, Toby.
'Cause you're not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports to close. Not every part of me belongs to you. This was personal. I'm not willing to relinquish that right.
Yeah.
Well, that's what usually brings on the episodes, but if you say so.
I'm sorry?
I don't know. [shakes his head slowly] It may have been unbelievably stupid. It may have been unthinkably stupid. I don't know.
I'm sorry. I really am.
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks.
