I couldn't disagree more, Cal. As long as these people are funding their public school districts with property taxes, neither the value of the schools nor the value of their property is going to go up. It's a vicious circle. It's terrible and it has to be stopped.
I wouldn't go that far. Anything else?
Thank you.
It's a vicious circle, Leo.
It never stops.
It just goes round and round…
…and round and round.
Now?
We really need to see him now?
Well… later.
Five White House Counsels in two and a half years. Cochran, Gates, Solomon, Tribbey. Why can't I keep a head lawyer around here?
I don't like new people.
Never played chess, though, have we?
See?
Oh, like you're not.
What is it with people from Chicago that they're so happy to have been born there? I meet so many people who can't wait to tell me they're from Chicago and when I meet them, they're living anywhere but Chicago.
He looks down his nose at me 'cause I'm not a lawyer.
I didn't go to law school. I got a Ph.D. in economics instead.
Yeah, and all that happened was I won a Nobel Prize and got elected President so I guess that decision didn't really pay off.
Should I run back and get my Nobel Prize?
Guy's been here three months he's got a nicer office than I do.
That matters less to me.
Hey, Oliver.
What are the bags for?
Oh… oh, gosh. Oliver, this…
…this can keep…
The man's bags are packed. Where are you going?
Asia's best-kept secret.
It's really not even… I don't want you to worry that much about it.
[to Leo] I'm easing in.
Well, Oliver, it really boils down to this I'm going to tell you a story and then I need you to tell me whether or not I've engaged 16 people in a massive criminal conspiracy to defraud the public in order to win a presidential election.
Not as much as a doctor. You should talk to a doctor.
I think what you're asking is, Is it possible I could be sitting in the Situation Room, have an attack, and nobody knows it.
Yes. My vision might get blurry. You wouldn't know that. My legs might get numb…
What's that?
(to Leo) What's he talking about?
I don't want to be careful about what I say in this room.
I want you. I meant, I don't need to be careful.
Yeah.
Have I ever been party to a lawsuit?
I was governor of New Hampshire. Anybody who…
(heavy sigh) A meter reader slipped on a patch of black ice in my driveway and I got dragged into some pain-in-the-ass thing over my great-aunt's will.
Yeah.
Oliver, why are we talking about my great-aunt's will and the meter reader?
I never lied.
No.
No.
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
Well, the Mexican economy crashed, an oil tanker busted up about 120 miles from here and 13 percent of Americans are living in poverty. So yeah, I can hang out with you and answer insulting questions for awhile.
No.
I have accidental death insurance as well as considerable personal worth. Were I to die, my family would not miss my government salary.
I don't have any anymore.
I'm the husband of a doctor and as a Governor and President, the various governments I've led generously…
No.
Yeah. Excuse me.
Sit down. Don't be scared.
My youngest daughter's got a big mouth.
We won't discuss this any more for the time being. It'll be public soon enough. And the more conversations you have with me, the more lawyers you're gonna have to talk to, and they bill in an hour what you take home in a week, so we won't discuss it except to say this you're gonna be subpoenaed. I'm confident in your loyalty to me. I'm confident in your love for me. If you lie to protect me, if you lie just once, if you lie just a little, if you lie 'cause you can't stand what's happening to me and the people making it happen, if you ever, ever lie…
…you're finished with me, you understand?
Say you understand.
Go back to work.
(turns around) I need you to go to law school and graduate as soon as humanly possible.
Well, I've got good news for you, Oliver. Turns out I didn't do everything right after all. Zoey had to fill out a family history form for Georgetown and because she was 17, a parent had to sign it.
Yeah.
I'd give anything if I had. It was Lady Macbeth. (pause) There's a bad moon rising, Oliver. We both know it. They're gonna take me out for a walk.
This isn't what you signed up for. Leo begged you to take this job. This isn't what you signed up for. If you leave, I'd appreciate it if you did it now, so it doesn't look like my lawyer bailed on me when the rain starts. No one's gonna hold it against you.
I guess it depends.
What would my first step be?
Yeah.
Yeah.
(quietly) Bring it on.
