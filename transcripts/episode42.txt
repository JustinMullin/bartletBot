Hey.
Welcome back.
How was the flight?
When Leo talked to you on the plane, he thought you already knew.
And I'm saying, we still do this. We're husband and wife and parents, and before we launch into palace intrigue, we do, "Welcome back. How was the flight?"
One of the forms Zoey had to fill out for Georgetown asked for a family medical history.
Did Leo tell you the rest?
Zoey wasn't eighteen yet when she started. A parent had to sign the form.
No, you did, Hot Pants.
It's gonna be okay.
Look…
[shouting] Cause I didn't! 'Cause that's… [lowers his voice slightly] 'Cause I didn't!
I talked to Zoey this morning. She's gonna ace her finals.
I hate Ellie's boyfriend.
I need you to speak to the White House Counsel, Abbey.
Leo, how could you tell Abbey about the health form before I did?
My wife and I are fighting battles on several fronts at the moment, including one with each other; can you and I be men? Can we have a bond?
How?
I met Joey Lucas.
How's he gonna feel about that?
This is a bad idea.
I'm coming clean, I'm doing it voluntarily. Anyone finds out, it's going to look like I did it because a poll told me to.
All right. [pause] Why don't you get Sam?
