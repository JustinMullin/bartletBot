He talked to her on the phone?
But he called her on the phone?
Yeah, but I'm saying, did she hang up the phone, turn to her friends and say, 'You're never gonna believe why I'm getting on a plane?'
What the hell is that?
[searching his front pockets for a pen] Is this a joke?
Where are we going?
Why?
You like the way it looks if we're meeting in the basement?
Good evening.
Yeah.
Excuse me. How many people in this room know Kenny's last name?
I believe this operation is no longer covert.
Josh?
[to Joey] Go ahead.
They may be right.
Joey, is there any good news there at all?
[sits in the nearby chair] What happened last night?
Yeah.
Where is the president-elect?
Sorry?
And that's not the most troubling…
Leo.
At the moment, there is no Dessaline government; there is no Dessaline! And I just got done pulling nine dead bodies out of Colombia. Evacuate the non-essentials. Get some Marines at the Embassy. And somebody brief Fitzwallace!
What?
How do we know?
What is Jake Bratt doing down there?
The trunk of his car?
Did we evacuate the non-essentials?
Let him in.
Let him in!
What happened?
They boarded the plane?
Leo…
That wasn't supposed to happen!
I evacuated the non-essentials specifically so that wouldn't happen!
I gave the order six hours ago!
[shouting] Six hours ago I gave the order! What the hell were they still doing on the runway?!
They shot three men…
We what?
And I'm sure these guys had their handbooks with them!
The plane is up in the air?
What's happening on the ground?
Who are we using?
And what does Bazan want?
On what charge?
I'm sold.
You're right, you know, I should be bringing them in on reelection. I should be talking to them.
I don't want to make the same mistakes over again.
Yeah. Let's start tonight. Around 9 o'clock we'll meet in the residence.
Bob Cratchit.
Never…You bought a new car?
And you paid sticker price.
You need to look at the next page - subsection B, paragraph four, Mamie Yokum.
Secret Service'd have you down like a calf at a rodeo.
[reading] "The definition of 'gift' excludes opportunities and benefits including favorable rates and commercial discounts available to the public at large."
And?
[removes glasses] Is the reason you didn't tell me you were getting a new car… you…? Did you think I was gonna think it was an extravagance?
You don't think I think you should have a new car? [pause] Delores, have you ever had a new car?
How about you let me find out what you were supposed to pay and write you a check for the difference?
[smiling] Is it a nice one?
Smell?
It's the smell of freedom…and the chemicals they treat the dashboard with.
When are you picking it up?
Do me a favor, would you? Come back here after you pick it up. I'd like to talk to you about something.
And put the car in the driveway. I'd like to kick the tires.
[jovially] It's an expression, Fannie Mae! Go get your car!
