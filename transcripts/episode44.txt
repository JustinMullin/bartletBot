Why?
Okay. Send Fitzwallace down. Anything else?
They've been in there 48 hours.
The guy's been President of his country for two days. He's spent them both at gunpoint.
What do you know about this storm?
It's moving from Florida to South Carolina.
It's a tropical storm.
No I mean it's been designated a tropical storm. That means it has a surface wind speed of something.
Isn't it strange to have a tropical storm in May?
I'm pretty sure there's a season and this isn't it.
I mean it's not a big deal. It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.
You ever been to National Cathedral?
You know you could lay the Washington Monument down on its side in that church?
We should try it.
[entering the Oval Office] I need pallbearers.
Excuse me. Keep going.
Charlie.
Do you have any idea why the door to the portico keeps swinging open? It's a little annoying.
[gesturing] But the door opens out.
[small smile] No kidding!
Charlie says there's a wind tunnel created by something. They're fixing the latch.
Yeah?
Okay. Well, we've got to go. I don't know what to say. Leo's pretty rich. Maybe he can buy some tech stocks and jack up the price.
What did she say?
The driver?
[absently] Yeah.
The world'll rest easier.
We're here.
Yeah.
[nodding] Yeah.
[nods] Yeah.
Leo, would you do me a favor?
[motions to the agents] Would you ask the agents to seal the cathedral for a minute?
[tired] You're a son-of-a-bitch, you know that?
[tired] She bought her first new car and you hit her with a drunk driver. What, was that supposed to be funny? "You can't conceive, nor can I, the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God," says Graham Greene. I don't know who's ass he was kissing there 'cause I think you're just vindictive. What was Josh Lyman? A warning shot? That was my son. What did I ever do to yours except praise his glory and praise his name? There's a tropical storm that gaining speed and power. They say we haven't had a storm this bad since you took out the tender ship of mine last year in the north Atlantic last year… 68 crew. Do you know what a tender ship does? Fixes the other ships. Doesn't even carry guns. Floats around and fixes the other ships and delivers that mail. That's all it can do. [angry] Gratias tibi ago, domine. Yes, I lied. It was a sin. [holds out arms] I've committed many sins. Have I displeased you, you feckless thug? 3.8 million new jobs, that wasn't good? Bailed out Mexico, increased foreign trade, 30 million new acres for conservation, put Mendoza on the bench, we're not fighting a war, I've raised three children…
[pleading] That's not enough to buy me out of the doghouse? Haec credam a deo pio? A deo iusto? A deo scito?
Cruciatus in crucem! Tuus in terra servus nuntius fui officium perfeci. [angry]
[betrayed] You get Hoynes!
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Yeah.
Yeah. [sits before the veranda door]
Yeah!
Yeah.
How are you?
That was the easy part.
[as they sit facing each other] Talk about the weather.
And there's a tropical storm seizing, right?
Okay, and how many times say, in the last hundred years, has a tropical storm come off the Atlantic seaboard to Washington in the middle of May?
At all?
Yeah. Thank you, Donna.
According to the NOAA, the storm is a non-recurring phenomenon, which is science's term for 'we don't know what in the world is going on, but we're stocking up on canned goods.'
This is stuff you don't think I'd remember from an hour ago?
Why?
Okay. [walks away and looks aside]
Yeah?
C.J….
First seat on the right.
My right.
Ah… Damn it! Mrs. Landingham!
[beat, as he looks at her in disbelief] The door keeps blowing open.
I was…
It's not that I don't know how to use it, it's just that I haven't learned yet.
I have MS, and I didn't tell anybody.
You're gonna make jokes?
[motions her to sit and sits down] The party's not going to want me to run.
I've got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham I've never been the most popular guy in the Democratic Party.
Give me numbers.
How about a child born this minute has one in five chance of being born into poverty?
44 million.
Homicide.
Three million.
Five million.
That's 13 million American children.
3.5 million kids go to schools that are literally falling apart. We need 127 billion in school construction, and we need it today!
Yes.
Yes, Sandy.
I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a bit of noise there, could you repeat the question?
