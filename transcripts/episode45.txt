Hello…
[to C.J.] What the hell's going on?
Ah… Please…
You women seem bright and lovely. The men? Disturbingly dense.
Excuse me… [to Charlie] Weren't you coming down to get me some apples and peanut butter?
[to students] So, we're stuck here, huh?
Well, I live here.
[to C.J.] I'm going back to my office. Nice meeting you all.
[turns around] Yeah?
[gently] I try to be.
[pauses, considers the question] A martyr would rather suffer death at the hands of an oppressor than renounce his beliefs. Killing yourself and innocent people to make a point is sick, twisted, brutal, dumb-ass murder. And let me leave you with this thought before I go searching for the apples that were rightfully mine: we don't need martyrs right now. We need heroes. A hero would die for his country but he'd much rather live for it… It was good meeting you all.
