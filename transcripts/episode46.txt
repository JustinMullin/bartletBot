Yes, Sandy.
I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a little bit of noise there, can you repeat the question?
[puts hands in pockets, looks away, smiles] Yeah. And I'm going to win.
Bruno!
Give it to Leo.
Abbey?
Listen.
Look…
That's funny, 'cause that's sort of what I did.
I don't.
[turns off T.V.] I don't, I swear.
Yeah?
Are you going…
Abbey…
I'm running again, Abbey.
Look, I have a lot to say…
What?
No, I have to go down, they're going to brief me on the evacuation plan for Haiti.
You'll be up later?
Probably three or four.
Not usually.
[raises his head] What are you all looking at?
What do you guys think the news is going to lead with tomorrow?
[chuckles] Yeah.
[walks in with Leo] Good evening!
Yeah.
So these helicopters land on the roof, and then…
What are the possibilities there'll be Haitian civilian casualties?
How long do I have?
OK. Thank you.
Yeah.
We're talking about a display of force?
And what is he up against?
It picks up weapons signals?
[nods, opens file] Peter, State's exploring the effectiveness of immediate sanctions?
We'll have a refugee crisis.
[beat] All right, let's go here. Nancy, Peter, get a message to the Canadian prime minister - we intend to restore Dessaline. The Canadians should tell Bazan if he doesn't move out we're willing to move forward with military options. In the mean time, I'm willing to consider a fly-by.
Now you're just bugging me. [sighs] That's all.
Yeah?
That it was politically motivated.
You think it's a sign of strength to invade Haiti?
Missouri could invade Haiti.
Sanctions aren't going to work - you said it yourself. The Haitian National Police will get rich of the contraband. Dessaline was democratically elected and instead of sitting in his office he's sitting on the USS Enterprise. To say nothing of the fact that they shot at us, and you don't get to do that.
I'm late.
Awasiwi Odanack. It's a Abenaki phrase that means…
[at the same time] …"beyond the village."
You want coffee?
What's happening?
When?
Yeah, all right.
Why?
[turns around briefly, still walking] Yeah, no, I mean, why?
It'll get wrapped up in one news cycle. I don't give a…
Screw it, and screw anybody who writes that story.
[smiles slightly] You have a hunch?
Of course the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week. If we announce in two weeks, that's when the first round of subpoenas will be handed down! [testily] Screw it! It's game time. Let's go!
Yeah.
[not looking at Leo] Yeah. [finally turns, still leaning on the fence, to face Leo] How's everybody doing?
[nods slightly, but looks skeptical] What about C.J.?
All right. [long pause, deep sigh] Laryngitis?
We could just say I have MS.
Leo?
I'm running for reelection, and I'm gonna win.
