[reading] We are more than a set of borders. We are bounded by the reach of human freedom. We have mastered every moment. We have vanquished every foe. We are strong. We are prosperous. We are at peace with the world. We are, as we have ever been, the envy of every civilization. We are, as we have ever been, the hope of all mankind. But I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before not to speak of the America we have, but of the Amer….
Yeah?
Okay.
(reading) "But I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before you not to speak of the America we have, but of the better, stronger, more prosperous America we can create together."
It's a garter snake. Don't worry about it.
(reading) "I seek re-election to the presidency, not because of its glories, but because of its challenges…"
Yeah?
All right. We'll revisit that.
(reading) "A presidential candidate owes his campaign no less than he owes his country; everything he has, everything he can give, all his hope…
Yeah?
(joking) Does somebody her have M.S. and they haven't said anything?
(reading) "But I am not satisfied." Indeed, Leo, I am close to taking my own life with a wheat thresher.
"And so with pride and purpose, I hereby announce my candidacy for the presidency of the United States."
[comes out swiftly] I didn't see you there…
I didn't see you.
Peter thinks sanctions are a waste of time and I agree. In about half an hour we're buzzing the island with… uh, what they call an Alpha strike formation - to show Bazan… I don't know. [goes into the bathroom]
[comes out with a towel] Sorry, I said I don't know, we'll see.
Yeah, it was bound to happen. [goes back into the bathroom]
Ah, it's Leo's call.
[comes out] Yeah, it's Leo's call. Look, I'm sorry, I can't get into our thing tonight.
I do, that's why I can't get into it. I have to read.
All right, I'm going to the study. [heads out]
[turns] Abbey, you were lying down when I came in. I didn't see you.
What does he want?
What else?
Where?!
Well, that's a bit of a dilemma. Does anybody have room at their place for Bazan and sixty of his relatives?
Yeah.
I want to handle this peacefully and right now. Nancy, what do you think of Venezuela?
Tell them I'll give the SPR strong consideration. Mike, have the Canadians get a message through: we'll unfreeze his US accounts but he can't remove any money from Haiti. Only his wife, his children and his parents can seek asylum. If he tries to go back, he'll be under arrest.
Tell me when it's done.
The State Department's suggesting that we praise the French government for their help in resolving this matter. I would, but I'm worried they'd surrender.
When do you think C.J. can brief?
Yeah?
[stands] Bruno!
I understand you're going to be working with us.
You have one or two demands.
You want 12 percent of the ad buys.
A room, a car, and a driver, that's no problem.
No.
I'm sorry, Bruno. Leo runs the show.
It's a deal breaker.
Can you help us out?
I've never been nervous talking in front of big crowds. It's talking to one person… [sees Abbey] I didn't know she was going to be here. [walks up to her] I didn't know you were going to be here.
I thought Leo was gonna…
Okay.
No, I think it's a good idea.
I don't know enough about agriculture.
Yeah, well, agriculture is responsible for one in five American jobs, so it is a little bit my field.
15 percent of the world's cotton, 25 percent of the world's beef, and 50 percent of the world's soybeans are grown in my field; farmers and ranchers pay taxes in my field, their kids go to school in my field, they go to jail in my field. From time to time they go to war in my field.
So when I say 'it's not my field,' I'm not saying something, I'm trying to learn so I can.
Why aren't you with me?
You're not.
I'm trying to read here.
Abbey…
Look…
[rolls his eyes] Can I go a week without explaining myself?
Sit down, we'll talk about it right now.
[sarcastically] Isn't there any way I could change your mind, 'cause I really had my heart set on it.
Yeah. C.J. wants her to introduce me.
I wouldn't mind a little… you know. There's gonna be a big crowd here tomorrow.
I need to finish the speech.
Come in.
Yeah. Don't be a marriage counselor. It pisses me off. Okay?
You know what I'm talking about.
That part of my life doesn't belong to you.
All right. That's all. I'll see you out there.
(looks up) Yeah?
Yeah, okay.
(sternly, raising his voice) That's nonsense to me and I don't care!
(yelling, gesturing) For all the new jobs we've created, there are single mothers working two of them at minimum wage. There are school districts where less than half the students graduate. And a kid born in Harlem is more likely to go to prison than a four-year college! They're bringing guns to school, C.J.!
(gently) I was never supposed to win.
I got in it polling in the single digits. Hoynes had it locked up. I got in it to give some speeches and keep him honest…
…then you guys came along and all of a sudden I got 22% in Iowa and then South Carolina and Michigan and… then Illinois.
(shakes his head) It was a mistake benching you for that last press conference.
(softly) I need you, too.
Did you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married to the same people they were married to before they went there?
I'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.
I'd have been a great astronaut.
I'd have overcome it to go to the moon.
(pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really happy about that.Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.
Say it.
They can look it up!
It's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Doug. It's our job to raise it. If you're going to be the "Education President," it'd be nice not to hide that you have an education.
Bruno, would you mind?
Churchill and FDR: serious men using big words for big purpose.
It occurs to me, I never said "I'm sorry." (pause) I am. (pause) For the lawyers, for the press, for the mess, for the fear. Bruno, Doug, Connie: these guys are good. They want to win. So do we. The only thing we want more is to be right. I wonder if you can't do both. The staff are all standing very still, listening intently to his words.
There's a new book, and we're gonna write it. You can win if you run a smart, disciplined campaign, if you studiously say nothing -- nothing that causes you trouble, nothing that's a gaffe, nothing that shows you might think the wrong thing, nothing that shows you think. But it just isn't worthy of us, is it, Toby?
It isn't worthy of us, it isn't worthy of America, it isn't worthy of a great nation. We're gonna write a new book, right here, right now. This very moment. Today.
You know what? Break's over.
