Charlie!
Are we out of pens?
That's a good pen, I need an everyday pen.
You've got crappy pens, with a plastic top. I need a solid pen that feels good in my hand, but it's not so formal I feel like a dandy.
I used to have the perfect pens. Every day right here, in my pocket. I loved those pens! Balance, great action, paper soaked up the ink what the hell happened to those pens? Do they not make them anymore? I kept that company in business.
You know, I just haven't gotten to it.
It's just been busy.
Is there a rush on this? [stands up]
I have five secretaries, to say nothing of the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury, and Education.
Yeah?
Things have been fine. I'm gonna have dinner and I'll be back in the office after, okay?
Are you having dinner?
I'll see you later [walks away]
[stops and turns] Yeah.
Charlie.
I'm expecting a call from Bill Horton and I left the National Fire Plan in the dining room.
Thanks.
The governor of Wyoming was an inch an a half away from calling me a pyromaniac tonight.
I'm saying somewhere out there is a registered voter who's thinking, 'You know, I thought I really liked this Bartlet fellow, but now that I see he's in favor of fire…'
It's the end of the season and the fire isn't anywhere near tourists. Letting this fire burn is good for the environment. You know how I know?
Because smart people told me. Please god, Leo, let them be right.
Any minute.
Yeah.
So it's starting to close in on the boundary?
[removes his glasses, gestures toward Horton] Yeah, but we're gonna make sure he looks like an idiot, too, right?
[smiling, to Horton] Wyoming is just going to have to have some faith that the Department of the Interior knows what it's doing.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
Josh.
A ballerina?
We'll go with that for now.
[takes off his glasses, looks up] Really?
[to Doug, pointing] You like this?
I thought you don't oppose a tax cut in an election year?
[nods] I'll say.
Actually, you stamp it, then sign it.
It doesn't matter if most voters don't benefit. They all believe that someday they will. That's the problem with the American dream. It makes everyone concerned for the day they're gonna be rich… The governors of Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, and Utah, along with the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House, are calling me a "fringe" environmentalist, 'cause I'm listening to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, along with the U.S. Forest Service, the Chief Ranger, and the Parks Superintendent.
They say letting the fire burn is good for the environment. And I'm betting on a weather report, of all things. It's just one of those times.
