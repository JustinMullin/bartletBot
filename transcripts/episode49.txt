There was a reason they had to cancel.
What do you think they're gonna be talking about?
They could have left after the entree.
They're gonna miss hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.
That's a pretty big price to pay just to override my veto.
What are you saying?
Leo…
So I'd think twice about vetoing.
And now?
Where is this thing?
You know what we're starting with tonight?
Hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.
It's on its way.
I say they could've waited until after the entree.
Sometimes it's like I don't even need to be here.
C.J., you look very nice.
Mullis?
Is it here?
Okay.
Hey.
What's your name?
They wouldn't. What do you got in the box, Mr. Dolan?
If the House successfully overrides the veto, we are weak.
NaCl, C.J.
Table salt. [gives the bill back to Dolan] Send it back.
[entering] Have the parents been notified?
Has anyone claimed responsibility?
Nancy, hasn't State issued travel warnings since Bekaa?
The Americans were targeted?
We know this?
Yeah?
You think there's an Afghan connection?
How long?
I'm going to want some temperature-cooling options.
Agency and FBI concur?
And we shouldn't be looking outside the box?
Retaliation for Bekaa?
If that's the case I want to hear it from Arafat's mouth. I want to hear it from him. A denunciation of violence. I want to see security cooperation with the Israelis.
Would you?
Hey. How you feeling?
It's all right.
Yeah, you're pretty gross.
It's good… but… a suicide bomber got two American kids in Jerusalem.
Yeah.
We're pretty sure. We got some things going.
19 and 21. They were brothers. You speak to Zoey today?
I thought the deal was she calls once a day.
I want her to call every day.
All right. You need anything?
Okay.
How?
So you think I get on the phone with the Chairman and…
It's gonna take more than that.
Congress?
We'll withhold the $100 million in NGO aid if they don't hand him over?
And you think handing him over puts the pin back in the grenade?
For a day?
[nods] All right. Set up the call.
This guy at the dinner, he told me something I didn't know. On Yom Kippur, you ask forgiveness for sins against God. But on the day before, you ask forgiveness for sins against people. [looks over at Toby] Did you know that?
[nods] You can't ask forgiveness of God until you've asked forgiveness of people on the day before.
[looks up at Charlie] Yeah?
Yeah, I'm gonna do this alone. Have a good night, everybody.
[sadly] Mr. and Mrs. Levy, this is Jed Bartlet. I have three children. I really don't know what to say.
