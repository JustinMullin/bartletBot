I'm fine.
Why would I want to do that?
All right, game point. Let's go.
I'm playing.
Take the ball out, Toby.
Take the ball out. Let's go.
You want to play or write my eulogy?
Mr. Grant!
I'm making a substitution.
Mr. Grant's a new member of my team.
Mr. Grant is a federal employee.
I beg your pardon?
When have I ever cheated?
And she did!
Well, I will admit that the woman bore a striking resemblance…
Be that as it may, Toby Ziegler, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young. I would like to introduce Mr. Rodney Grant. Mr. Grant is Associate Director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness. Game point. Your ball. Let's go!
What?
What's the problem?
Take the ball out, Toby. Game point. Let's go.
The new man.
Let the poets write about that there, Byron.
No, Helen, I don't. The U.S. economy is fundamentally…
From the… Miami Herald?
But, your voice sounded the same as when you did Helen.
No, not at all. The U.S. economy remains fundamentally strong as the steady decline in unemployment reflects, which I think is cause for satisfaction, not gloom. The solitary aberrant spike in the P.P.I. is not cause for overreaction.
I AM an economics professor with a big old stick up my butt, but I'll do my best for you there, Mandy.
We don't need to do guns.
I'm not saying they're not gonna ask about them, Toby. I'm saying I'm all set.
[looks at watch] Is it time for my 10 a.m. scolding?
Let's do guns.
Let's do guns, Sam.
Yes, next question.
Ah! Mr. Ziegler from the Coney Island Killjoy. You have a follow up?
Yes.
'Cause I'm weak-willed and stupid.
Then I talked it over with some other people.
I have lots of other people.
I'm not gonna come out and say the bill we just passed is worthless.
Yeah, my answer was gonna be 'because I said so,' but you did pretty good.
What's your point?
[eating a bagel] Well, on behalf of everybody in the west wing, Toby, let me just say that that's a relief.
[still eating] I think this press conference is about we haven't had a press conference in a while.
We're going too.
Leo's not talking about the portion being accounted for as off budget and particularly not the long-term capital outlays.
Ten years ago, the federal budget had a deficit of 22 billion dollars but the national debt rose…
…from 5.2 trillion to 5.4 trillion in the same fiscal year.
Thank you. That's a debt increase of 188 million against a 22 billion dollar deficit. [reads note] Oh, this is good news.
[to Leo] Zoey's coming for dinner.
Yeah. [to everyone in room] My daughter's starting Georgetown after the first and she's scouting off-campus housing. Guys, we're done. I'm sorry, but some of my staff has been waiting and they haven't had the chance to bother me for a couple of hours. Thanks so much.
I'm gonna make chili!
I'll make it for everybody. Charlie!
My friends, my daughter, my beer, and some chili. Yes!
Ah, Charlie. My youngest daughter, Zoey, is down from Hanover. I'm making chili tonight. It's her favorite.
The first lady's in Pakistan. I can eat whatever I want.
I'm gonna need some ingredients.
Don't ever listen to him. Look, Mrs. Landingham's got it all written down somewhere. Just tell her to give it to the steward's office. And send everyone else in.
Thank you, Charlie!
[hand in chest] God, I was right?
Everyone! Come in. Come on in. Hey, listen up everybody. Zoey's down from Hanover. I'm making chili for everyone tonight.
[looks at Leo then to his staff] All right…You know what? Let's do this. Everybody look down at the big seal in the middle of my carpet.
Now, everybody look back up at me. Zoey's coming down from Hanover and I'm making chili for everyone tonight.
There, you see how benevolent I can be, when everyone does what I tell them to do. Now sit down. [picks up a newspaper and reads. Everyone else sits down.]
[still reading] Cause it's Hollywood. Who gives a damn?
Why can't we do both?
No.
Because Sam is right. It's not that Larry Posner's movies have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. It's that they suck. They're terrible. But people go to see them because they have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. Now, if we could just get people to stop going to see crappy movies, Posner would stop making them. I promise you.
[stares at Toby] Do I look like Joe McCarthy to you, Toby?
Chili, tonight!
Sam, it's all about mastering the fundamentals, see? Got to keep your hands up, your feet moving on defense. Pass and get open or find the open man, and follow his shot on offense. See, I am a master of fundamentals, and that is why my team so thoroughly dominated your team.
[walks away] Leo, kids don't understand the fundamentals.
Mrs. Landingham, are you drunk?
I just like asking.
Oh, give it up. Where's Zoey? [takes beer from Mrs. Landingham]
No, I guess not.
Yes.
[looks away] Yes.
We were up all night on that one, Toby. Me and Leo and Josh. They were screaming at me, 'Governor, for God's sakes, it's got to be Toby. It's got to be Toby.' When I held my ground, and we went to David Rosen, and Rosen said he wanted to take a partnership at Solomon Brothers, thank God… I couldn't live without you Toby. I mean it. I'd be in the tall grass. I'd be in the weeds… I know I disappoint you sometimes. I mean I can sense your disappointment. And I only get mad because I know you're right a lot of the times, but you are not the kid in the class with his hand up and whatever it was you said to C.J. You are a wise and brilliant man, Toby… The other night when we were playing basketball, did you mean what you said? My demons were shouting down the better angels in my brain?
You think that's what's stopping me from greatness?
I suppose you're right.
Thank you, Toby. [beat] Now, go away.
Josh! We've been looking for you.
Look at this, will you?
I don't know why, but nothing makes me feel quite so good as the sight of colleagues, enjoying each other outside work.
We were talking about these women.
Look at C.J.
She's like a fifties movie star, so capable, so loving and energetic.
Mrs. Landingham.
Did you guys know she lost two sons in Vietnam? What would make her want to serve her country is beyond me, but in 14 years, she's not missed a day's work, not one. [beat] There's Cathy, Donna, and Margaret.
Uh, excuse me! Thank you. Uh, friends, please… Well, chili's ready and I hope you all enjoy it. In fact, since I told you you would enjoy it, I'm reasonably certain that you will.
You know, of course, the first lady's in Pakistan. [starts to walk around the room] I'm not entirely sure why, but I have learned it's a pretty good idea not to ask my wife too many questions as it seldom leads to anything but further confusion. I miss her very much, but I'm delighted our beautiful daughter, Zoey is here. You know, she's starting Georgetown in the spring.
This, prior to medical school and a life of celibacy.
It's an incredible adventure you're starting on, sweetheart. An amazing four years full of people and experiences you haven't yet dreamed of. And if you will allow me just one minute of business, please. I hope that by the time we're done with our four years here, we'll have seen to it that every young person who chooses can go to college and beyond, regardless of their economic status.
I understand that today was another one of Leo's 'big block of cheese' days! You all start out so cynical, but it never fails. By the end of the day, there's always one or two converts, right? And today was no exception. C.J. Cregg is gonna be up all night writing a position paper for the interior department on the necessity of wildlife protection. [C.J. laughs.] C.J., I don't mind the cost of this wolves-only highway. It's the segregation. The ACLU is gonna file a petition on behalf of some reindeer and then we're all screwed.
Sam Seaborn had a guy who spotted a UFO today, am I right? Sam laughed him out of his office, but you've been thinking about it ever since. But you can rest assured, Sam. It was not a spaceship from another planet, just another time. A long since abandoned Soviet satellite, one of its booster rockets didn't fire and it couldn't escape the earth's orbit--a sad reminder of a time when two powerful nations challenged each other and then boldly raced into outer space. [beat] What will be the next thing that challenges us, Toby? [looks at Toby] That makes us work harder and go farther? You know, when smallpox was eradicated, it was considered the single greatest humanitarian achievement of this century. Surely, we can do it again. As we did in the time when our eyes looked towards the heavens, and with outstretched fingers, we touched the face of God. [beat] Here's to absent friends, and the ones that are here now. [holds up his glass of wine]
