[mumbles] It sucked.
It sucked!
Oh, like I'm not already going to hell.
It did lack penache.
Yeah. She's skipping over the part that says, "Wives, be subject to your husbands as to the Lord, for a husband is the head of a wife as Christ is the head of the church."
Why?
Okay.
[behind his desk, puts on glasses] "In splendor." And I have no problem with Ephesians. And any time you want me to cleanse you with the washing of water, you know I'm up for it.
Hackery!
This guy was a hack! He had a captive audience! And the way I know that is that I tried to tunnel out of there several times. He had an audience and he didn't know what to do with it.
Couldn't have hurt. Words…
Words, when spoken out loud for the sake of performance, are music. They have rhythm, and pitch, and timbre, and volume. These are the properties of music, and music has the ability to find us and move us, and lift us up in ways that literal meanings can't. Do you see?
Yes, I am. And God loves me for it.
For other stuff, not for this. You can't just trod out Ephesians, which he blew, by the way, it has nothing with husbands and wives, it's all of us. Saint Paul begins the passage: "Be subject to one another out of reverence to Christ." [passionately] "Be subject to one another." In this day and age of 24-hour cable crap, devoted to feeding the voyeuristic gluttony of the American public, hooked on a bad soap opera that's passing itself off as important, don't you think you might be able to find some relevance in verse 21? How do end the cycle? Be subject to one another!
No, it's not about me! Well, yes, it is about me, but tomorrow it'll be about somebody else. We'll watch Larry King and see who. [shouts] All hacks, off the stage! Right now! That's a national security order.
How does Mrs. Sinatra feel about that?
[sings] You make me egg foo yung…
[turns to her, sings] You make me feel there are songs to be sung…
[smile fades away] Yeah, okay.
Ah, damn. Charlie, can I see Leo?
Yeah.
Okay. [walks with C.J. quietly] When do you think I should go in there?
You'll talk to the sheriff's office and…
I guess the DA.
Yeah.
You heard?
C.J. thinks I should wait a few hours.
Yeah.
Be subject to one another, Leo. What can I do to be of subject to you?
Yeah?
Okay.
He's not going to want to do it.
What are you doing today?
What about?
Keep me out of it, all right?
You think I should send Hoynes to Texas?
All right, get him over here.
Yeah.
Charlie!
You took Indianapolis?
Yeah?
Thank you.
Hey, John.
Do you know this church?
The United Baptists Church in Abilene?
Listen, you feel like having a beer with me?
On Sundays, when we got back from church, my father would let my brother and me split a beer. It got to be a habit.
Nancy? [to Hoynes] I need you to go to Texas, John. [Nancy walks up.] Nancy, could I get a cold beer and some ice water?
And close the door please. [sits] Nancy does what she was told.
It's what Texans do. [beat] You know, a decade ago, we passed a few national gun control laws, and the gun lobby turned its back on Congress and started focusing on the states. [Hoynes sits] The NRA systematically worked the legislatures to weaken conceal-and-carry laws, the effect of which is to increase gun sales and pad its own membership.
The National Conference on State Legislatures is meeting this weekend at the Convention Center in San Antonio.
Yeah.
[pause] It's also what Vice Presidents do.Nancy comes in and serves them beer and water.
Thank you, Nancy.
John…
And if you look at the state of New Jersey, which has a "may issue" law-if you look at changing that one word…
Changing that one word means law enforcement can decide who gets a concealed weapon and when and where they can carry it. Texas has a "may issue" law in front of a legislature right now, and you going down there…
It's counter-scheduling. You go in front of an unfriendly audience. You tell them something they don't want to hear-it shows you have courage.
You're a hero in Texas.
Texans don't like that you have the courage of your convictions?
[beat] Oh, yeah. I forgot.
That's not good enough.
A tradition that's passed on from father to son? We tamed the frontier, John. We did that already.
Let them stand in this room and say that. On this day. Let them stand in this room. I like it?! She was nine years old!
Green Bay lost. [beat] She was nine years old.
Well… that is an excellent point. I never saw it that way.
Tighter ax control.
She didn't…
You know what? Last year, gun deaths? 30,708. Alcohol deaths? 35,450. Tobacco deaths? 400,000. Marijuana deaths? Zero. This guy, the second shooter-Rambo? He's gonna get nothing. He's gonna get a parade. You know why? There was no sign posted in the church saying you can't carry a concealed weapon. [beat] I'm just playing devil's advocate. She was nine years old.
Can I ask you a question, just out of curiosity?
If guns are meant to deter the threat of crime, what's the point of concealing them? I mean, wouldn't you want the criminal to see that you've got a gun?
Then what's the answer to that?
You don't know?
We can't all just agree it's a stupid-ass amendment that was written before there were street lamps, much less police forces, and move on?
There's no need for a citizen militia.
Then say so.
Only 16% believe gun ownership is an absolute right. Only 9% believe it's an absolute wrong. There's a middle. We can win them!
Which we wouldn't have been doing if…
Nothing.
[fuming] You outed me, John. With that trip to Nashua, with the oil companies. You wanted people to start asking questions.
[yelling] So did my wife.
Look…
Yes, it was.
It's not easy being my Vice President, is it?
I wouldn't think so. [walks around behind his desk and leans on it] But it's the only way you're gonna get the nomination. You know that, right? If I win.
Yeah.
You'll go to Texas?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Thank you.
No.
