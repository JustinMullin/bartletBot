The propellers aren't going.
They know I want to leave now?
The propellers aren't going.
That makes sense. Also, there's a chance I could get hit getting on or off.
Excuse me?
You think I'm not tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One?
I duck when I get on that helicopter, and you should, too. It's just good safety sense.
They know I want to leave now?
Filing day, Charlie. Last to get on the ballot in New Hampshire. [puts jacket on]
I'm going myself. Or, I could send an aide.
I'm going myself. Always have, always will.
Fair enough. Always have, never will. But I'm going myself. You know why?
It's a profound statement about democracy. Are you mocking me?
The thing before wasn't a crack about my height?
Yes, I am. I'm going myself.
It's not a problem. I'm up, I'm back. The whole thing takes two hours.
I do love doing this. It's one of my all time favorite…
Why not?
What is it?
Yeah.
Right.
What does "we don't have it" mean?
We don't have it?
And they're in North Korea?
[takes coat off] Yeah. I think I'll go ahead and cancel that trip, Leo. If only to stick around to see how this sounds worse than it really is.
I think you will.
Where's the damn submarine, Nancy? I don't want to hear I don't know, I want to hear how many people are out there swimming around looking for it.
Shut up.
How long can the crew survive down there?
Yes.
How close are these guys to landfall?
[incredulous] Four thousand yards? They get that close?
[looking at Leo] Four thousand yards?
Can they send a distress signal?
They would wait to send a distress signal and risk their lives?
Well, that's great. I assess the national interest by the number of people alive, not dead. You have four hours before I order the Pacific Fleet into Haeju Bay.
I agree.
Is Peter still recovering?
All right. We'll talk to someone else. Someone we trust.
Anybody but…
Anybody but him.
Why?
So does Peter.
[flustered] Was it… I don't… Was it major heart surgery?
He's gonna scold me. He's been at the State Department since Truman. He thinks I'm a kid and that he outranks me.
I've gotta tell him I lost a submarine. Can I make something up, like "say, a friend of mine hypothetically…"
Bring a copy of the constitution. I'm gonna show him I'm not scared.
Hey, Bruno, can you devise a campaign strategy that involves beating the crap out of Leo?
Every single election…
Legislature, house, governor.
President.
Is he here?
Okay. It's a profound statement about democracy.
Good morning, Albie.
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Soft drink?
Okay. Okay. I've asked you here, Albie, because you're the assistant Secretary of State and I, of course, am the President.
See, right away…
Lake George.
Thanks, Albie. That much, the National Security Council has made clear to me.
And if they were in trouble, you see, they wouldn't send a distress signal 'cause they might be detected and submariners have a different set of criteria when assessing risk versus reward.
Okay, I'll just stand over there.
Cause for war. Little thing called Latin. Albie, if we tell North Korea we've violated their waters it could be interpreted as an act of war?
We tell 'em it's not.
Okay. [to Leo] Can I talk to you alone for a second?
Let's not call North Korea just yet.
Leo. Gut feeling. Has the boat gone quiet?
All right. Three more hours.
Who?
Also, he'd be good to have around for morale, 'cause he's Mr. Happy Fun Guy.
Albie. I'm gonna ask you to stay around for a while.
Charlie!
Charlie, could you have someone bring some Schweppes' Bitter Lemon and the Constitutional Order of Succession, please?
Oh, God, I'm sorry, am I still here?
I haven't lost the boat yet, Mr. Secretary, and I happen to be the only one in the building who thinks we should be sending the fast attack subs right now. And I'm an hour from gathering the NSC and calling Japan.
Leo…
There was a UN action, Mr. Secretary. Sixteen countries were involved in that police action, Mr. Secretary. Thirty-three, thirty-four thousand American dead. How come we're the only ones still fighting? Where did everybody go?
Yeah.
Send him in.
Hey, Josh.
No, give it to me now. I want a distraction.
Give it to me.
That's okay.
The question?
[without hesitation] I don't.
Good.
Leo.
Okay.
It's time.
Yeah. We're going now.
What happened? Did you contact Pac fleet?
And San Diego, right?
Tell me what they do.
Whiskey Three?
How many trips will it take?
What about injured?
Let's go get 'em. Time's up.
What?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
All right, okay. There they are. See, they went deep and quiet to avoid a close-aboard with a Luna class destroyer. What you gotta do in these situations is you trust the captain, you trust the crew.
Hey.
It got filed?
It got filed?
So I'm on the ballot in New Hampshire.
Okay. [pause] When Romans ran for the office of Counsel - did I just see you roll your eyes?
They wore whitened togas to show their intent - a bit silly, perhaps…
But it was an act of personal commission.
What?
You're pretty mouthy today.
Hey.
Hey. Do you duck when you're getting on Marine One?
Okay.
I think the blades are high enough.
I heard.
Yeah, listen. I want you to go easy on him. He's a conscientious and dedicated guy. It's not an easy question.
Why do I want to be President?
[sighs] I've been thinking about it for the last couple of hours. I almost had it.
