I'm not wild about Camp David.
I'm not the only one, either. Bess Truman didn't like it. I read that somewhere. She thought it was dull. [pause] But there I go, Thanksgiving at Camp David.
[pause] It's not a place you go at Thanksgiving, not when you have a farm.
No.
What makes you think it's a farm?
Farms have things you can grow, and animals.
I want you to learn more about farms.
Yeah.
Doesn't matter. Thanksgiving's where your family is, and this year my family's at Camp David. Why, I do not know. Abbey didn't wanna schlepp to New Hampshire. Schlepping in a 747. It's not like we were gonna have to carry our own bags or anything, but I do not argue.
Were we talking about something?
[pause] You know that line you're not supposed to cross with the President?
No-no. Look behind you.
Would you like to leave?
Damn right, with my permission. [stands]
It's the brine that keeps the meat soft, lady. You soak it overnight in water, salt, sugar…
Seventeen kinds of spices including?
Now you can go.
Bess Truman didn't like Camp David, either, she thought it was dull. Doesn't matter.
Long as you've got an oven, and you go to three hundred and twenty degrees. You take your turkey, which has been soaking overnight in water, salt, coriander…
She was asking me.
Yeah.
Hey.
This is some sort of pre-emptive psychological thing?
That's not going to work.
I saw the message calendar. I'm having some difficulty navigating the color-coding.
Well, there should be a separate color for things I don't care about.
Providing low-cost cell phone service to neighborhood watch groups.
Really?
There's nothing wrong with the policy, it's just too small. I could fund this initiative out of my pocket.
Leo could fund it out of his pocket. Shouldn't this be local government, like the YMCA or something?
We pass minute, but easy to understand.
How popular?
Get out of here.
Bring me that polling data.
Cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts, andouille sausage.
Inside.
It'll cook.
It'll cook.
I've got it covered. Anything else?
I know they're coming out. What's it going to look like?
Fewer.
…carroway seeds, thyme, cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts and Handui sausage.
Yeah. But Toby seemed to indicate that you have to be careful if you cook it inside the turkey, because in some cases it doesn't cook, and when that happens, people get sick.
You know about this?
[walks into the office] 'Cause I thought Toby might be playing with me.
But you said you've heard of it.
Nah, you don't have that kind of wit.
I need to talk to an expert.
I can't ask Rene.
No. No, I can't. Thanks Margaret.
I can't ask Rene right now.
Well, frankly, I thought he did something stupid and inconsiderate last week, but it turns out I was just in a bad mood.
Yes. And while he didn't deserve it, he will someday soon.
82 percent are in favor of fixing potholes?
I'm gonna look at this.
They want the nickel and dime stuff, I'll tell you one thing we can do.
This time of the year there should be a hotline you can call with questions about cooking turkey. A special 800 number where the phones are staffed by experts.
What do you mean?
[pause, takes off his glasses and stares at Charlie] Butterball has a hotline?
Are you kidding me?
God, I'm sorry, I love my country. Charlie, get me the number for the Butterball hotline.
Hang on.
I don't think this is the right one.
Yeah, this is something different. Hang on a second. This is-- [pause] Son of a bitch. [walks up to Charlie] Find Bruno Gianelli, tell him I wanna see him right away.
Get him in here.
What the hell is this? [waves the poll in his hand]
What is this?
[gets up and walks over to Bruno] It's a poll. I asked to see a poll about certain… doesn't matter. Then send up the wrong poll. This one asks voters where I should spend Thanksgiving.
What the hell are you doing polling where I should spend Thanksgiving?
I have Thanksgiving with my family.
Thank god!
You politicize family to make sure they don't look political.
My family is off limits. [throws the poll on the couch and walks to his desk]
I'll decide when I've used them up. You don't poll where my family goes, am I making myself clear?
What?
Ah, something important!
The number for the Butterball Hotline. [starts dialing] Watch, and learn.
Hello…
Charlie!!
Toby!
Come in, please.
You polled where I should have Thanksgiving?
And it was okay with you?
Why?
You think people should care where I have Thanksgiving?
All right. Doesn't matter. I straightened it out. It has a lot to do with kelp.
Shhhh. Hello!!
Well, first let me say, I think this is a wonderful service you provide.
I'm a citizen.
[sighs] I'm Joe Betherson…sen. That's one 't', and with an 'h' in there.
Fargo.
[with evident strain] My street address is 114… 54 Pruder Street, and it's very important that you put 'street' down there because sometimes it gets confused with Pruder Way and Pruder Lane. Apartment 23 R… Fargo, North Dakota…
Zip code 50504.
I do radio commercials for… products.
[sits down] Stuffing should be stuffed inside the turkey, am I correct?
Well, then we'd have to call it something else, wouldn't we?Toby sits down and puts his hand under his chin.
If I cook it inside the turkey, is there a chance I could kill my guests? I'm not saying that's necessarily a deal-breaker.
All right. Well, first of all, I think you made the second bacteria up, and second of all, how do I avoid it?
Excellent! Let's talk temperature.
No, see, I was testing you! The USDA calls for turkeys to be cooked to an internal temperature of 180 to 185 degrees.
Okay. Good testing!
Oh yeah. It was presented to me as a gift from the personal sous chef to the king of… [Toby raises his hand.] auto sales in…
Fargo. Phil Baharnd. The man can sell a car like… well, like anything.
And you do, too. Thanks a lot! [hangs up the phone, stands up] That was excellent! We should do that once a week.
I gotta get better at the names.
No. One more thing left. Today, we find the traitor in my family. I know the First Lady doesn't like to schlep, but would you please tell her to meet me in the residence?
Hi.
Yeah, sorry about that. Listen, I'm sorry about this, too, but we have to change plans.
We're gonna have dinner here at the White House. Charlie's calling everybody.
[removes his glasses] I've seen some polling information. The numbers are staggering. The people are looking for steadiness. For a father figure. They like it when I'm here. [puts glasses back on]
I guess not.
It's no problem.
It's their job.
I've got polling numbers.
[snaps book close and removes glasses, pointing them towards Abbey] J'accuse! [stands]
J'accuse, mon petite fromage!
Nothing's wrong with my French.
[pause] That's right!
And what part are you leaving out now?
Yes!
[puts his hands in his pockets] You know what? It was.
Well, with the ingredients for stuffing, you have to cook them before you put them in the turkey, and you're not gonna know whether I did or not.
Me, too.
