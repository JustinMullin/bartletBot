[yells from behind them as they enter the hallway] Toby!
Come with me for a second, would you?
No problem. Are you straightening things out with the Smithsonian?
I'm supposed to speak at the opening of an exhibit marking the sixtieth anniversary of Pearl Harbor, but there's a small veterans' group that objects to the exhibit on the grounds that it's America bashing.
Frank, what was added?
Yeah
The point is that we've dotted the I's and we're ready to announce.
Let C.J. know but have her pass it off to the DoD.
Not totally.
I don't know, every time we make one of these deals with a place like Qumar I feel the women around here look at me funny.
You think it's just guilt?
Well how should I deal with guilt?
[laughing a little] Yeah, okay.
C.J.'s going to be cool with this, right?
I'm just saying she knows who the good guys are, right?
Okay, thanks.
What's next?
Hey.
Did the Celtics win last night?
Okay, when I say did they win, you can just say yes or no.
What are you doing?
I'm not on you, I'm just asking.
Modern American history sucks.
You want to study history, study the Crusades, the fall of the Roman Empire from Theoddoseus to Justinian.
Damn right the Visigoths. Modern history's another name for television.
Is there any way I can help?
I'm a master of modern history, you can ask me anything.
[pausing] I don't know.
They said you needed to see me.
What's going on?
Hey.
Oh man, they got it again?
[pause] A US case?
How long?
Do we say anything in the meantime?
Yeah, we got to wait.
The second we say positive, beef futures collapse, and we lose 3.6 billion in beef exports. Fast food is deserted, supermarkets pull beef, it's panic - I want to talk to some more people, but in the meantime, we wait.
[reading] All right. Unfunded mandates.
Don't give me their grumbles.
Are employees in wheelchairs supposed to work in the parking lot?
How much would it cost the federal government to amend the unfunded mandates we format to cover all unfunded mandates?
Let's find out for sure then tell Siegel to sit down and shut up.
No.
So paint a picture for me, would you?
How many?
That's the live cattle. What about the beef?
That's a hundred and fifty billion dollar industry. What's the West going to do for a living?
People have known about this disease; they're still eating beef in record numbers.
And then the corn and soybean growers, right?
Any good news?
So we've got frightened parents, rising food prices, public panic, massive layoffs, and something we've never had to worry about before, we're wondering when the next case is gonna happen. The most costly disruptions…
Always happen when something we take completely for granted stops working for a minute.
[sighs] Okay.
Oh, hey - do you know when we passed the Clean Water Act?
How could you not know that?
What'd I just say?
[as they exit the Oval Office] All right.
Nope, nothing.
No.
You know, Charlie…
History can't be reduced to dates and names.
Nah. I'm starting you out with a copy of the speech George Perkins March used in 1845 to rouse the agricultural community of Rutland, Vermont. Then you're going to need to study on the word "ecology," as coined by the German biologist Ernst Heikl.
[walking back to the Oval] Better in the original German, of course, but obviously the translation will be fine.
You really wanna talk about the lawsuit in Colorado?
You hear about the lawyer who opened a chain of dry cleaners? "Press your lawsuit while you wait?" [pause] There was a better joke in there someplace, right?
Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity. You can't sue the king. We brought it over from England.
Forgot to bring that one over.
The RNC has a press conference when I sneeze.
Congress won't pass it.
People know where I stand. If they don't know, they can ask me.
And I was for it then. Never did anything about it because nobody wanted it. And, frankly, why waste time in Capitol?
I can't be responsible every time somebody irrationally twists my meaning. People are responsible for themselves.
Today's cars are safer than they've ever been. They've all got air bags, they've all got seatbelts, and they're all crash tested from here to Tuesday. All that's left is personal behavior and bad luck, and, I'm not responsible for either one. And, Sam, if Mrs. Landingham w as here right now, she'd say the exact same thing. You know what I'm saying?
I don't blame this woman for suing me. I'm not a king, and I'm not sure the law should treat me like one. Though certainly for the moment I don't mind. I'm not blaming her. She's got to go someplace with her grief and her anger. The ones who should be horsewhipped with a horsewhip are the ones exploiting her grief for political gain, and I'm not getting down with those guys.
[walks back to behind his desk] Let Congress pass that law. I'll sign it.
[to Charlie] Yeah, let's go. Get Leo.
Thank you.
Isn't there a joke to be had with lawsuits and dry cleaners? I've been working on it all day.
Yeah.
Hey.
Okay, what do we think? When do you tell the public what you know?
[to Leo] Something going on with them?
[pause] If it comes from the President--
All right, that's what we'll do then.
Toby.
What's going on with the Smithsonian?
Where are you leading them?
You're changing.
Yes, you are.
Okay.
Ah, Toby. We've gotta straighten out Medicaid.
You know, after the Civil War, veterans had to come to D.C. to get their pensions? They had to visit the office personally. They waited for a clerk to look through all the Civil War records until their papers were found. You know what their papers were bound with?
Red tape. That's where it comes from.
Go and apologize to C.J. for whatever you did.
Like that matters.
What's next?
What?
What? [checks his watch and walks over to Charlie]
It was interesting, but what?
I forgot.
Hey, I forgot. Get the information from Toby, I'll make the call myself.
Get the information. Get the director of the CMSO on the phone.
1972.
Is when we passed the Clean Water Act.
You know nothing about the Visigoths.
And I know everything.
