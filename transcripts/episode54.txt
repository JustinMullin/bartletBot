[on phone] Listen, I don't care that much about your ass but if you need to perjure yourself to protect me you're going to damn well do it.
Whatever it is Josh does, you're going to let him do it.
Yeah, yeah. How does she look to you?
Her.
What's she wearing?
I like you and her. It's like a '50s screwball comedy
What was that?
I'm not doing anything tomorrow night.
It's Christmas Eve.
Yeah. Actually, nobody does.
You got about a thousand people in this building standing with you right now.
Okay.
[attention being interrupted from his reading] Huh?
Thomas Hilton started a fishing village here in 1623, Allen.
Yeah.
And a slogan's going to do that?
Yeah?
Oh, oh, slow down, you're going too fast.
$367 million in snowmobiling?
[clearly joking] And the goggles… That includes the goggles?
Okay. Thanks, guys. [shouting] Mrs. Landingham! Thanks.
Speaking of crusty New England relics…
Nah. Abbey wants to eat at Patsy's tonight. Would you let them know we're coming?
What's next?
Leo's here?
[yelling] Leo!
Yeah, yeah. Hey.
Jenny and Mallory are okay?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing…?
Everything's okay?
Why didn't you call?
Where are you staying?
What do you want to talk to me about?
I think that's great, man. I think it's about time. You probably mean the House, but I think you should consider the Senate seat in Illinois in two years; I can help raise money.
Hey, Leo, I swear to God there's no one I'd rather see in the Oval Office than you but if you run there's going to be a lot of discussion about Valium and Alcohol. I mean, it's going to come out; this is the world.
Who?
What? Leo takes a napkin out of his pocket, licks it, and sticks it on the posterboard easel. It reads "Bartlet for America."
Well, the phone calls have been coming all morning, Governor. You should know that Algiss Skyler called.
Skyler wants to know why the hell you haven't.
Was Eisenhower wrong in '57? Kennedy in '61?
We don't know what the situation is, do we, Josh?
Do we know what's going on, Agent Casper?
Edward, so far the churches have been empty. There have been no fatalities. But tomorrow night's Christmas Eve. They're going to be packed. So why shouldn't I send troops in?
This doesn't happen in New Hampshire.
We'll meet again this afternoon. Thank you, Governor.
Josh, stick around.
So, what have you got cooking?
I said, what have you got cooking?
Yes, you do. I know what happened at the third debate. He told me. I know what's going to happen this afternoon. What are you going to do? Are you going to try and get Gibson out of the room when it's his turn to question?
Where are we?
Abbey's about to get spanked. Guys, the things we do to women. My wife's a world-class scientist.
Yeah.
Which one's he?
They're all young.
Listen, they want me to do some things before South Dakota.
Yeah, we're lookin' past that.
Full financial disclosure…
They want me to take a physical.
What's a physical right now gonna show?
[shakes his head] I'm not lying to anybody, Abbey. I'm taking a physical - a physical which I'm under no legal obligation to take. I'm doing it voluntarily.
Now is when people are listening. I'll make my speeches, get whooped on Super Tuesday, and we'll all go home.
[softly, with regret] The things we do to women.
Toby?
Josh?
Sam?
C.J.?
[turns to look at Leo] All right, let's do it.
[smiles] Senator.
I'd like you to be the Vice-President.
Why don't you sit with Abbey and me for a few minutes. [turns to aides] Can I have the room, please?
[to Hoynes] You want anything? Coffee or anything?
You ran a good campaign. [pause] You're a young man. You'll be back.
There's something you need to know. It's why I asked everyone to leave the room. [short pause] A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a relapsing remitting course of MS.
Multiple sclerosis.
Yeah.
I told you because it's something you're gonna need to know. But also because I wanted to show that I trust you.
[unfazed] Yeah.
[doesn't flinch, pauses] Well, what do you say?
[stands] I'd like your answer now, John.
I'm gonna stretch my legs.
Yeah?
Tell me.
Conspirators?
All right. Here come the Tennessee Volunteers. Reverend, have the pastors encourage the women to bake those guys something nice. They're all spending Christmas Eve where they don't want to be. Ed, you get to be a hero to the blacks in your state. Anybody in your state doesn't like it the FBI is calling the shots. What could you do? Anything else?
I'm sorry. I've forgotten your name.
How'd you get him?
A two-year investigation gets its first crack from a broken taillight.
God, well, some of the stupidest criminals in the world are working right here in America. I've always been very proud of that.
Thank you, Agent Casper.
So, what's going on?
It's not going to happen?
It was a long shot, anyway. Look, I wanted to see him spared this but Leo's made out of leather. His face has a map of the world on it. Leo comes back.
All right.
Damn it.
It's good.
[glancing around] It won't be later. This is a 550 seat theater and they'll be seated a half-hour before we start, so the temperature'll be up four to six degrees.
[softly] No.
[looking at floor, swaying] No, no. Not now.
[gasping softly, trying to keep his balance] Yeah.
G'abbey…
G'abbey…
Well, well, well.
Dodged a bullet.
[genially] Which is more than I can say for me in Rosslyn.
Did you get a date with her?
I did the church thing in Tennessee okay. I did it without you.
So anyway, I have a present for you.
Merry Christmas, Leo.
That was awfully nice of you.
