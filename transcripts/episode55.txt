Charlie.
How was your weekend?
What'd you do?
Time well spent.
Weren't you going to a flea market?
You didn't have to do that.
Nice sucking up.
Look at these topographical details. Seriously, I'm going to have this framed, this is great.
No, I'm going to play with it some more.
Look at this map. 1709. The Dead Sea, Jordan River, Mount Sinai.
You want to come inside?
Thanks again, Charlie.
How'd it go?
Yeah.
What did they offer?
They didn't offer nothing.
Censure?
Well, I get it but see what you can do about it, okay?
No, I've got a security briefing downstairs.
Hey.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
There seems to be a growing consensus that no one's going to believe I'm serious about paying down a trillion dollars of the debt when I'm willing to spend $200 billion on the child poverty fund.
I'm not saying we're not going to do it. We're just going to find a different way of saying we're going to do it.
Anything else?
Thank you. What's going on?
Fiction or nonfiction?
What else?
All right. Hey, you want to see something? Charlie gave this to me. It's a map of the Holy Land, drawn in 1709. He got at a flea market. It's hand-colored, copper engraved. I was going to put it in the outer office.
Yeah.
Why?
Yeah.
Why?
It was drawn in 1709.
There was no Israel.
Israel wouldn't happen for another 250 years.
So, what's the problem with the map?
Why?
Take lunch, would you?
"By God, I'm 50, alive, and the King all at the same time."
…it matters a great deal."
Are you trying to tell me something?
Okay.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Hey, C.J.
You, too. What's up?
Let's lay odds.
I've heard about the book.
Yes?
Yeah?
When you're going to be a father you're rooting for ten fingers and ten toes, and that's it.
Wait. I want to show you this great map Charlie found.
C.J.?!
There was no Israel in 1709.
So, it's not on the map.
That's ridiculous.
If I put it someplace else?
Leo has--in what used to be his house when he was married--a map of the United States. The first third of it is the 13 original colonies. The second third of it is the French territory of Louisiana. And the third third is Mexico. In this map of the United States, there is not a single state. That's because when this map was made there was no United States.
I am the President of the United States and I'm not offended by it.
I'm having it enlarged and bolting it to the hood of my limo. They don't want us to put up our map, Charlie. They're philistines in the fight for freedom but that doesn't bother us, does it?
Never mind.
That's the key. An old map. An old map. Spin that.
Anything else?
Thank you.
Sure.
Everybody's working late.
How's it going?
The early drafts look good.
I heard. Look, I'm really not going to talk to you about my underwear.
No, but I guess that doesn't mean it wasn't.
I don't.
I don't even remember the meeting.
Why does it matter?
I said, "Why does it matter?"
Neither do I.
Excuse me.
You want to step in for a second?
Yeah. No. A little bit. Mostly, I've been talking with Babish and some of the deputies. The Chairman, Trent, the Speaker, the Minority Leader.
Yeah, I'm going to do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's another reason.
I was wrong. I was. I was just…I was wrong. Come on, you know that. Lots of times we don't know what right or wrong is but lots of times we do and come on, this is one. I may not have had sinister intent at the outset but there were plenty of opportunities for me to make it right. No one in government takes responsibility for anything anymore. We foster, we obfuscate, we rationalize. "Everybody does it." That's what we say. So we come to occupy a moral safe house where everyone's to blame so no one's guilty. I'm to blame. I was wrong.
As a matter of fact, it's not a Joint Resolution. The President still has to sign a Joint Resolution so, technically, it's a Concurrent Resolution. House Concurrent Resolution 172. The lawyers will haggle over the wording in the next few days. So, at least I'll make history, huh?
He was censured in '34. He got it expunged in '36.
No. Let me ask you something. You may be the last sane voice around here.
I don't believe this.
In Lebanon. Not here. It's not like I'm thinking "God, I was going to recognize Israel, but now that I've seen this map…" You know what? Let's just sit here quietly.
