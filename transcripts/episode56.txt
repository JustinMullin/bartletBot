I'm sorry?
Abbey just went to take a phone call.
[to Bobby] What did you just say?
Right. The part I understand was Bobby saying we could cure cancer in ten years.
In other words, make it so that people could live with it?
What is standing between us and that happening?
Who at this table knows?
How much money would it cost?
He just said…
He just said ten years. I want to hear about this from the beginning. Talk to me like I'm not an oncologist.
I want to call everybody in. I just had dinner with some of Abbey's friends. They're all oncologists. I think in the State of the Union, I can announce that I'm directing our researchers to have a cure for cancer in ten years. Call everybody in.
Good evening. Thanks for being here so late.
A President stood up. He said we will land a man on the moon before the end of the decade. You know what we knew when he said that? Nothing. We didn't know anything. We didn't know about the lunar surface. We didn't know how to land one of these things. All we'd ever done is crash it into the ocean. And God knows we could figure out how to land soft. We didn't know how to blast off again, but a President said we're gonna do it, and we did it. So I ask you, why shouldn't I stand up and say we are going to cure cancer in ten years?
Nobody knows.
Toby.
Why?
How?
You think people with cancer care what my motives are? You think their families do?
Joey?
Once again, why would somebody…?
I didn't…
Sam.
Why shouldn't I do it?
I'm sorry. I know it's late, but I want to start seeing drafts of a new section in the next few hours. C.J., I want a sense of a media overview, too.
Now.
I just want to look at some drafts.
Yeah. Come on in.
You got it?
This is good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'd want to include the Society of Clinical Oncology.
The OMB would have to score it. We haven't identified the offsets to pay for it. We can barely tell them what the it is.
[sighs] It was a good idea though.
So we don't get water from a rock. We just do our thing and take our chances.
[stands] We're gonna have to do it awfully well this time.
Anything else?
Somebody get these guys some pie.
