You can check a whip count, but I don't think we get 60 votes in a cloture motion.
I think we lose eight Democrats once they find there is a foreign aid budget. [beat] Anything else?
What's up?
Look, he's gonna make statements during the primary that force me to move to my left. It's not like I get a swing at every pitch, right?
You and I know different.
Every candidate's dream opponent, huh?
I'll take a look at what Sam does.
I'll take a look at it.
No. I reworked it.
Yeah. I was trying to avoid a quote.
It's purposely nonspecific.
We get the word out to our friends, but I was obviously nodding in the direction of affirmative action.
Nobody's questioning where we stand.
I don't want to campaign today.
We will, but we don't… Man, we don't have to piss people off everyday in order to demonstrate that we're not…
Look, we're going to Iowa where we already won. I'm not ignoring the state, and I say thank you for getting me elected in the first place, and we're back on the plane. And I'll tell you what else. I don't think it's a good idea for us to be fighting for news coverage with three governors, two senators, and the head of the church of I Hate You. Let's just get in under the radar.
I'll say a few words.

[stands to get the drinks] What do you think?
Toby, if you have something to say, please say it.
[sits] My family signed the Declaration of Independence. You think I've got an ethnicity problem?
Yeah?
It's always been like that.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.

You're gonna sing a country western song?
[stands] This stopped being fun for me a little while ago.
It was actually never fun for me. I was just being polite.
[with back turned] Excuse me?
[pause] Yeah.
He hit me. Why?
I'm done being polite now.
Toby, it was a complicated relationship. Can I help you?
It was a complicated relationship.
Why are we talking about this?
You have stepped WAY over the line, and any other President would have your ass on the sidewalk right now.
They would've had you on the sidewalk a long time ago. [firmly] I don't know what the hell goes on in a Brooklyn shrink's office, but get it the hell out of my house!
