[to Leo] The speech is going out?
Okay.
I'm Jed Bartlet.
I guess we knew that?
I've been having trouble sleeping.
You understand that this is an election here, right? I mean by itself who cares? The President's having trouble sleeping, he talks to a doctor, but with the MS and the hearings and you're a psychiatrist…
[nodding] Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, we know you. You helped Josh out last year?
Me, too.
How would I know?
Thank you. [sits]
I can't sleep.
I stay awake.
Four nights.
Right.
Yeah.
The third night.
Not 'til the next morning in the middle of a national security briefing.
[getting up] Stanley, I think you're under-selling yourself when you say you're not an expert in sleep disoders. 'Cause you've been right straight on the money so far.
[lighting up] Not many.
Never has before.
[looking down at the cigarette] You think if I put this out, I'm gonna fall asleep?
Then let's move on.
No.
No.
No.
I'm sorry. Before we get to lifestyle factors, I'm just gonna turn this on.
When we're done writing it.
[folds his arms] Like what?
Nah.
No.
Noise?
Planes aren't allowed to fly over the White House.
Right.
Four or five hours.
Psychological factors.
What were the odds?
No.
Well, Congress was investigating me.
And I was censured. Then I had to give the State of the Union.
I'm running for reelection.
Things are blowing up everywhere, and I have chosen the General Assembly of the U.N. to define a tougher foreign policy. Not unusually stressful, no.
I don't like the word "stress". It's a Madison Avenue word. It's something that can be cured with flavored coffee and bath bubbles.
I have a job I like, and my family's healthy.
Stress is for other people.
I'm saying it's not stress. I was feeling stressed five nights ago, too and I slept fine.
I want my money back.
I get that a lot.
So, what do you charge?
For three hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour, you ought to bring your own damn lingerie.
There's a great story about Arthur Miller. "Death of a Salesman" had just opened on Broadway the night before, and he was walking around his old neighborhood in Brooklyn and he see's a hot dog vendor that he went to high school with, and he says, "Hey, Jimmy, it's me, Arthur Miller." And the hot dog vendor says, "Artie, how you doing? What you been up to?" And Miller says, "I'm, you know, I'm a playwright." And the hot dog vendor says, "Hmm, play writing, I should've gone into that." Three hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour.
For what?
I can't sleep. I can't sleep. I'll be tired and I'll lie there and it doesn't happen.
I won the Iowa Caucus.
That's not enough?
Say what you'd say to anyother patient.
[sitting up] I had a conversation with one of m aides that night after we got back from Iowa. He called me on something.
Well, I guess we talked about a lot of things. Who we think the Republican challenger is gonna be be, and imcumbency and campaign stategy, strategic overview, but the long and short of it is, my father never liked me at all.
Yeah, I'd thought you'd enjoy that.
I told you…
What's wrong with my head?
Of course not. That would be three hundred and eighty-five dollars an hour.
It's not good for a person to keep setting goals?
Well, I'm told that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.
I have abilities.
I think I have.
I think you're talking about the Lincoln Bedroom.
That's not easy.
It's not easy.
I think I've made tough choices.
You don't know anything.
I'm not trying to get my father to like me.
What?
Stanley, I hate to put it this way, but I'm me, and you're you, and we're done when I say we're done.
