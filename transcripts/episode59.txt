Thank you!
I'm sorry?
We spoke several times about Kashmir, and she assured me they're working towards a peaceful resolution. We also had a spirited conversation about chess.
Chess was invented in India. Somewhere around 600 A.D., a gigantic chessboard was constructed at Fatehpur Sikri which was the capital a long time ago, and human figures were used as chess pieces.
They moved at the Emperor's will. That's what I like to call the good old days.
[to the press] In sandlewood, and a laquered classic Stanton in boxwood.
[over his shoulder as she leads him away] Hey, don't forget! [checks watch] Hartsfield votes in three hours and 21 minutes! We're gonna find out who the next President is.
I'm gonna give some of the chess sets out as gifts, did you see them?
Did he say-?
Yeah?
What's going on?
Where?
What's China's reaction?
Big?
How big?
No. I mean, we could try, but they're not gonna go for it.
What are they asking for?
Tonight?
I'm assuming Nancy and Fitzwallace and the Chiefs…
You?
We have a pretty good sense of the worst-case scenario?
That sounds right.
All right, we know the play.
She gave me these beautiful chess sets.
Yeah. I'm on my way. Let Fitzwallace know I'm gonna order the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait.
[to the driver] Let's go.
Good evening.
Listen, they start voting in Hartsfield's landing in about two and a half hours, so this may end up being somebody else's problem. [General laughter. Everyone sits.] The scale of the war games is unprecedented?
That's our next move.
After our next move comes their next move.
Excuse me.
Thank you. How are you?
Yeah, it's from me.
The Prime Minister gave me a few different sets, and I wanted to give them as gifts.
The State of the Union was really something else.
This one's a Lotus set, hand-carved camel-bone. She told me it came to her from a direct descendent of Tan Sen. You know who that was?
The greatest musician of his time.
Sixteenth century. He'd go to the human chess matches at the Mogul Court of Emperor Akbar, and that began the family obsession with the game. Wanna play?
Yeah.
Why?
No, I'm none of those things. I'm just grand.
[opening his hand] You're white, but don't ever touch me.
I was kidding.
Ah, the Fibonacci opening. Very interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A billion dollars at the Export-Import Bank didn't hurt.
Three billion in direct foreign investment to the forty-four billion China gets. You're an American, where would you rather put your money?
Why?
That's right.
It's bad. If Kashmir's the most dangerous place on earth, the second most dangerous is the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's got four hundred thousand troops on high alert; the size of China's war games is unprecedented.
You think I should?
Why not?
That's right. Plus guess what? [makes another move] The Patriot tests aren't why China's showing its teeth.
Are you ready to come inside?
By the end of the week, Taiwan's going to announce they are holding their first free elections.
Defend your queen.
Okay.
Yeah?
Yeah. [turns to Leo as Charlie leaves] Give us a minute, would you?
Thanks.
Thanks. C'mon in.
What's it say?
No, that's for you.
That was a joke. Not so funny, huh?
It's a gift, for you.
Yeah. It's hand-carved, it belonged to the Prime Minister's grandfather. He used it to play with Lord Mounbatten.
Nah, she didn't, we just boosted it from the palace on our way out. I've got some little bottles of shampoo and conditioner, too.
Sit down.
[removing his jacket] Come on, now. You were out of line, I was a jackass - let's call a truce.
[sitting down] Let's play chess.
Yeah; he's… one, two, four, eight, twelve moves away from checkmate.
Yeah. You take white.
With Jawaharlal Nehru when they came to an agreement on the necessity of India's independence.
Yeah.
Taiwan's not gonna be our topic. Ah, the Evans Gambit!
A variation of the Giuoco Piano opening, named after a British sea captain, W.D. Evans, who invented it in 1820 - don't tell me chess moves.
Well, it's as popular today as it was back then.
I'm sorry?
Re-election and the Bartlet Psychosis.
So we get right back on the horse.
You apologized already, so let's get back on the horse.
That makes it more likely we'll learn something.
Yeah?
Excuse me; eleven moves.
Take your time. [beat] See the whole board. [beat] Think happy thoughts…
Sure.
The Spanish brought chess to the court of Charlemagne in 760 AD. Charlemagne is French for Charles the Great. The Charles is a river in Boston. The Hudson River is actually not a river at all…
Now take your time. [beat] See the whole board.
It is in the Catskills, but once it gets to Manhattan, it's a tidal estuary.
Yeah.
Well, how do you think it went?
That's right, except they didn't call them Patriots. What did they call them?
Right.
Good.
No.
Right.
Yeah.
[looking at the board] Your move.
Move.
Right. [takes one of Sam's chess pieces] I gotta go back to Toby in the other room. He's trying a Balducci attack. [walks out]
See the whole board!
Let me tell you, you're really showing me something tonight. A lot of spunk, a lot of pluck, this game isn't all about size, you know. There's a little thing called heart, and you've got it, my friend.
Check.
I had a friend in school who taught me. He was good. He was ranked 18 and under. He was a really nice guy, everybody liked him.
David Wheaton. Everybody had a crush on his sister.
He went on to Princeton and Christmas vacation, he'd saved up to go to San Francisco and he was on the wharf and he saw a guy beating a woman up and he went in to stop it and the guy stabbed him to death.
So you know, I had this historic stretch of sleeplessness after our last meeting?
Got so bad Leo brought in a guy from ATVA who worked with Josh.
Yeah, but we know him, and I figured he had to go to school for everything, so… Anyway, we brought him in late at night.
He said it was your fault. He said you shouldn't bother me so much.
I'm kidding.
Let's go ahead and say the Republicans nominate Ritchie.
First of all, I'd stop for a moment and say, you know, 'why?' I mean they got some serious guys in the field. Kalmbach, Daniel, Wesley?
That's true.
[responds with a move] You think the strike against me is nobody likes the smartest kid in the class.
I don't do that.
And I'm not a snob.
If a guy is a good neighbor, if he puts in a day, if every once in a while he laughs, if every once in a while he thinks about somebody else and, above all else, if he can find his way to compassion and, and tolerance, then he's my brother, I don't give a damn if he didn't get past finger-painting. What I can't stomach are people who're out to convince people that the educated are soft and privileged and out to make them feel like they're less, then, you know, 'he may be educated, but I'm plain-spoken, just like you!' Especially when we know that education can be a silver bullet, it can be the silver bullet, Toby! For crime, poverty, unemployment, drugs, hate…
I'm saying I don't watch the pitch go by.
And if I do, it's not because my father…
[beat] Can we talk… God, can we talk about, please, can we talk about my father with some respect? The man's gone, can we… he's my father, he wasn't a Dickens character!
Yeah.
Check.
Check.
Check. I'll be back.
Don't cheat. I know exactly where the pieces on the board are. I know exactly where the pieces are on Sam's board. I know exactly where the pieces still are on David Wheaton's. [leaves]
All right. [to Leo] You can bring the ambassador back now and get Beijing.
The Aegis Destroyers.
I don't know, but for sure we're gonna blame you.
I don't know. Toby keeps coming back at me with this… I don't know. He says I let the pitch go by.
I soften… I smooth myself out publicly. It's not a put-on, by the way, I'm honestly folksy.
Yeah what?
You agree with him?
I don't.
Yeah, well, he keeps coming back at me.
All right. [turns to go]
Just playing some chess. [walks out]
[approaches to sit across from him] What's your point?
I don't want to be killed.
Pick your king up. We're not done playing yet.
Sorry. I got tied up.
Let's get back to it.
Yeah.
No.
Look at the whole board.
You're not.
Sam…
Are they in the Taiwan Strait?
Is that the same thing?
[to Sam] Like this.
Turn them around. I'll make some calls and thank people.
Thank you, by the way.
[sits down] Okay.
Right.
Yes.
Ten years, but you've got it.
And so…
[shakes his head] But everybody wakes up alive in the morning and saves a little face.
You have a lot of help. You listen to everybody and then you call the play. [rises to his feet] Sam. You're gonna run for President one day. Don't be scared. You can do it. I believe in you. [looks at the board] That's checkmate.
