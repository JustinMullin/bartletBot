There is one fruit…
There is one fruit…
There is one fruit…
There is one fruit whose seeds are on the outside. Name it please.
No.
I bet five.
It's the strawberry.
Yes you did Toby, and I thought it was a bold move when you consider that Leo's holding the six you're looking for.
That depends…
There are fourteen punctuation marks in Standard English grammar. Can anyone name them please?
That's only seven. There are seven more.
There are three words, and three words only in the English language that begin with the letters DW.
Can anyone name them for me please?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I see you five and raise you five by the way.
'Witches brew a magic spell, in an enchanted forest where fairies…'
Well, the answer's correct but let's check with our judges and -- oh no, I'm sorry, time's expired.
My time.
Trip nines.
Kiss Jenny for me.
Charlie, I'm headed over to the residence, you're done for the night.
Don't stay up too late son.
All right. [long pause] What body of water in South America is formed by the confluence…?
Not quite up on your South American geography are you my friend?
Saved by the bell.
What tripped the alarm?
She?
It wasn't a fraternity stunt?
Well, you know, just trying to kill me isn't necessarily evidence of being mentally unbalanced!
I wasn't?
Who was?
Zoey?
Leo.
You know Ron Butterfield?
He says it was a woman!
Of course. [to Leo] This woman was after Zoey?
There's no need for Zoey to know about this right?
What do you need?
Hang on a second. What've you got Ron?
Well, I guess that's something.
[to Leo] You were saying?
You sure?
[to Leo] All right, thanks. [to Butterfield] I guess we're done too.
No, no.
You too. [pause] Ron?
Did she have a gun?
Okay. Thank you.
[to the phone] Yes. Yes. Of course. [to Josh] I'm on a conference call with the postmaster general.
I honestly couldn't tell you.
Look, I want you to do me a favor.
Take Charlie out for a beer tonight.
Yeah. The kid has no life. You're the only guy around here he knows at all. Take him out for a couple of beers, you guys come back, we'll all watch the vote in Leo's office.
Good, thanks. Let me give you some cash.
[puts hand in pocket] Don't be silly.
You sure?
Truth be known, I don't have any cash on me.
I don't carry cash anymore. I don't carry keys either.
How's it going in there?
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure.
Yes?
I'll take the call wherever I am when he calls, I guess.
I'm not adopting a tone. I'm just trying to get out of here.
I'm saying no. I just want to go home.
Goodnight Mrs. Landingham. [to Leo] I heard it's done?
Good. I'm headed over to the residence.
Sure.
You're kidding me?
Leo, you're kidding me?!
What happened?
Don't tell me nothing happened, Leo. I know you. I know Jenny. Married couples like you don't just get divorced. Not cause nothing happened!
I want to talk to Jenny.
I don't understand how this happened Leo. You and Jenny were happy!
Because you weren't spending enough time with her?
Marriage needs attention Leo. It can't run on autopilot. Come on. It's not your prom date we're talking about here. We're talking about your family!
You can't blame this on me.
When did it happen?
And you're just now telling me?
[walks over to the door] Fix this, Leo.
It IS as simple as that. You're the man. Fix it.
Fix it.
Goodnight Leo.
What happened?
Did you do anything at all to provoke these guys?
Were you flirting with them?
Zoey, you flirt with guys.
So what were you doing?
What the hell were you doing drinking?
I'm gonna up your protection.
Yes.
Starting tomorrow.
Well you'll have plenty of friends to walk you to class.
Zoey!
You're getting this part of your life.
Oh please.
Look, the Secret Service…
They are worried about me getting shot. I'm worried about me getting shot. But that is nothing compared to how terrified we are of you. You scare the hell out of the Secret Service Zoey, and you scare the hell out of me too. My getting killed would be bad enough, but that is not the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario, sweetheart, is YOU getting kidnapped. You go out to a bar or a party in some club, and you get up to go to the restroom, somebody comes up from behind, puts their hand across your mouth, and whisks you out the back door. You're so petrified, you don't even notice the bodies of two secret service agents lying on the ground with bullet holes in their heads. Then you're whisked away in a car. It's a big party with lots of noise, and lots of people coming and going. And It's a half hour before someone says, 'Hey where's Zoey?' Another 15 minutes before the first phone call. Another hour and a half before anyone even THINKS to shut down all the airports. Now we're off to the races. You're tied to a chair in a cargo shack, somewhere in the middle of Uganda. And I'm told that I have 72 hours to get Israel to free 460 terrorist prisoners. So I'm on the phone pleading with Benjamin and he's saying, 'I'm sorry Mr. President, but Israel simply does not negotiate with terrorists, period. It's the only way we can survive.' So now we've got a new problem, because this country no longer has a commander in chief, it has a father who's out of his mind because his little girl is in a shack somewhere in Uganda with a gun to her head. DO YOU GET IT?!
[long pause] I'm sorry I yelled sweetheart. Forgive me. Honey, I want you to have your freedom and your youth. I want you to have common everyday experiences with girls your own age. But don't ever forget - this is a privilege, and it is an experience that must be cherished beyond measure. And proper protection and security, though at times I admit, it's a drag, is never too high a price to pay.
It's alright sweetheart. It's alright.
Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you.
Don't get up!
Hi. Before, when I was being an idiot, there was something I forgot to say.
I'm sorry.
I would like unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.
I don't know what the hell was the matter with me, Leo. If there's anything I can do to help, anything?
Josh?
What were you doing taking my daughter out to a bar?
I told you to take Charlie. When Zoey said she was going I just assumed you were gonna go have malteds or something.
Yes.
Well anyway. Thank you for doing whatever it was you did.
[opens the door] Charlie? Sam, you come too please.
[to Josh] You know, I once played the stage manager in a production of Our Town.
Charlie, you a good poker player?
Excellent, get your money out and take a seat.
Punished? No.
Because I said so.
Good evening.
Good work both of you. You bought us some time.
C.J., deal the cards.
