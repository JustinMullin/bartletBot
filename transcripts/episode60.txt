[without looking] I do.
[still not looking] Are they new?
[still not looking] You've worn them?
[still into his puzzle] I love them. "Laissez-faire doctrine." 15 letters.
No, that's not the answer. See, 'cause Social Darwinism isn't a doctrine. It's a force of nature. The answer is "libertarianism." [scribbles down his answer]
Take your time.
Boo boo, I gave up on getting you out the door in the late 70's. Plus, it's your birthday. You're old, and you don't move around that fast.
I know, so I'm shading in the extra box. [scribbles on the puzzle]
It's your birthday week. It's a week of festivities like Mardi Gras or Lent. Three letters. "It may be bitter." "Tea," right?
Yeah.
'Cause "woman" doesn't fit.
Hey, when the Medical Board gives you the results of the hearing, do they slap it up on one of those X-ray light boards? "Here's where the problem is with your testimony, Abbey. Here and here."
See, I know it sounds like you're praising me, but…
[pause] It's not your life or 12 years of anything or anything. They're gonna give you the very least they can give you.
Well, that was stupid.
Standing by your convictions isn't gonna get you anywhere. This isn't some guy off the street talking. I'm a very successful politician.
About 200, but that was five or six hours ago when it started.
"Body organ, produces hydrochloric acid." That's the kidney, right? Or the lima bean?
See, they can't take medical school away from you.
Abbey, come here.
I know you're scared. I'm very confident. So you be whatever you want. Whatever happens happens tomorrow. Tonight is your birthday party, and your earrings are great, so are your shoes. So can we, for the love of God, get out of this room?!
Yeah.
Pheasant and morel consomme, miniature ravioli of fois gras and smoked goose confit, a little Canary melon sorbet as a palate cleanser, all served on the finest Lenox china.
A '97 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. A '94 Hog Cellars Zinfandel.
I'm like Gatsby, but without the problems.
Hmm.
I kind of wished you'd mentioned that before.
[quietly to Abbey] It's gonna be relaxed. It's gonna be relaxed.
[to Abbey] For dessert, we're having Kumquat Napoleons.
Okay.
Amy.
Donna was invited. All the women of the west wing. We're doing a calendar.
Now, it's a party!
All right.
You know, John, there are places in the world where it might be considered rude to talk about the physical attributes of another man's wife.
That was nice of her. [reaches for the other glass but pulls back when Marbury takes it for himself]
What did I do?
Look, obviously, we knew this was gonna be a thing, but it doesn't have to be tonight, right?
I'm pretty sure he means Leo.
No.
[to Abbey] So! So far so good.
[calls] Charlie!
I'm gonna need you later.
I want to work on my toast.
I don't need help writing it. I can write a damn toast. I just want to say it out loud to somebody. Any warm body is fine.
So when I give you the signal, we'll go off someplace.
It'll be something like "Charlie, we're gonna go work on the toast now."
You finally got here.
I think Abbey's gonna pull a hamstring about tomorrow.
About what?
I'm feeling all right about it.
[turns to look at Abbey] I don't know. She's pretty pissed.
Yeah.
All right.
Loved it.
"I've known my wife, Abbey, for nearly 150 years." No, I'm not gonna do that. She's not gonna think that's funny.
Okay. I should… Yeah. Okay. "Thank you all for being here tonight." By the way, do you know where the term "toast" comes from?
Yeah.
I was talking to you.
The Stuarts. They put a piece of toast in your wine cup to improve the flavor.
1643. Members of the Middle Temple toasted Princess Elizabeth by pledging to die in her service.
C.J., I haven't seen you all night.
Charlie.
[to C.J.] What is it?
No. Damn it.
We're pretty sure the Board was evenly divided, and Nolan was the deciding vote, which dictated a lot of her… Damn it!
Yeah, they worked together for 20 years, and I was the governor who appointed him to the Board.
C.J., you should probably tell Abbey.
Thanks.
The Union-Leader says Nolan's gonna recuse himself.
They're gonna suspend her license for a year.
And?
I was pretty concerned about that.
Can you leave me alone? I'm trying to be a husband, and your mojo's getting all over me.
This is Brendan McGann, right?
Yeah. I don't know what to say about that.
Yeah.
Okay. Here we go.
That's when the juices get flowing.
I could tell the story of the ditch digger.
You know the story?
Abbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said, "Aren't you glad you married me? You could've married a ditch digger." And she said, "Jed, if I'd married him, he'd be President." What do you think?
Why?
It is.
Very deeply.
No, it won't.
In my house, anyone who uses one word when they could have used ten just isn't trying hard. Let's keep at it.
[yells] What the hell is going on?!
I was gone for 45 minutes. They were all Americans when I left.
I called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are different when it comes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand that. I also think partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good thing. He's gonna consider not recusing himself.
Okay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the ditch story, but I wanted to say that I love you very much.
Don't call me that.
I'm standing right here!
