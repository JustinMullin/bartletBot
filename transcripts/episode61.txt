Good to be talking to you.
The Mural Room as a matter of fact.
That's right, and Thursday night we're going to talk about energy dependence versus independence and cleaner burning fuels that get up to 80 miles per gallon versus oil-based fuels that pump billions of pounds of pollution into our air and perhaps just as important our vulnerable to very volatile price spikes. We want to talk about controlling our destiny through innovation instead of relying so heavily on foreign oil.
Yeah. 65% of the world's oil reserves are in the Mid East. 3% are here at home. I, for one, wouldn't mind sending a little less of my money over there and the only alternative is to use less oil.
I hope so, but there'll be plenty of time for campaigning come the fall. Thursday night is about America's energy future.
Thank you, Kim.
I'm-- Terry, I'm sorry.
That was my ninth interview this morning.
Well, I guess we'll be ready to run against whoever we have to run against.
Rob Ritchie? I don't know him very well.
Thank you.
We can talk about my book.
Yeah.
Thanks.
What else?
Got it.
Okay what?
Drilling/exploring.
Saudi Arabia bad.
Okay.
Why are you smiling?
Okay.
Good morning. Thanks for having me.
And to shill for my new energy plan, which is about raising fuel economy standards, working with Detroit to develop hybrid cars, and using tax incentives to promote alternative energy.
After a decade of wars with Iraq and a spread of religious extremism in Saudi Arabia, we still rely on this very dangerous, very uncertain region for a quarter of our oil reserves. And I, for one, wouldn't mind not sending quite so much of my money there.
Exploring is what Magellan did and Balboa and Jacques Cousteau. What we're talking about is drilling which is the only way you know if there's oil there and which will forever damage national treasures like ANWAR.
Clean Coal is a term that pollsters came up with 'cause it polls higher then regular coal. What we want are real cleaner burning fuels. We want to control our destiny through innovation and that's what we're going to be talking about Thursday night.
My pleasure.
Leslie, right?
Thanks a lot.
There'll be plenty of bait in September-October.
I'll read it when he does.
I don't know, Leslie. I think we might be talking about a .22 caliber mind in a .357 magnum world.
Okay, thanks again. [to Toby] Who's next?
What?
Sorry I'm late.
We hearing from the Michigan delegation?
Polluters aren't going to write the environmental laws. What about the Energy's Workers Union?
It is.
What else?
For what?
Let me ask you something. You're pretty dumb, did you take offense? Look at that. I did it again.
Yeah?
Calling me impolite?
I don't know. I guess the biggest names.
All right, I'm going back to work.
(singing) Another sky Another June Another something that rhymes with June Another reason, another season For makingâ€¦ (stops singing) Wait a sec.
No, wait a sec. He's absolutely right. Hang on.
Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting. No, no, keep your seats. Leo? You're absolutely right.
We shouldn't show up. Tell the Whip we want to yield all our time. While they're going in front of the cameras complaining about me making fun of Ritchie, the Democrats will be caucusing on literacy and tuition tax credits. We want to yield all our time.
Thank you.
All right, here we go. What time is it?
[to the room] Thank you, everyone.
C.J.?
I've been meaning to tell you, you've done really well this week with the open-mike thing.
Didn't turn out too bad.
