Okay. We're e-filing the old 1040A. You're single, head of your household, Deanna's a dependent, your adjusted gross income is $35,000 per annum.
I love doing this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Suckers. Okay. Your mom's Social Security pension benefits is $1536. Police pension $2400.
"Do you take standard deduction, or do you itemize?"
Did you make any charitable donations?
Really?
[after typing] You're better off with the standard deduction.
I'm hitting 'send' now. If you're lying about any of this, you're going to the joint.
It's gonna tell us what your refund is, but I've done a quick calculation, and it'll be $700.
You spent it already, haven't you?
Yeoman of the Guard?
Can I tell you what's messed up about James Bond?
Shaken not stirred will get you cold water with a dash of gin and dry vermouth. The reason you stir it with a special spoon is so not to chip the ice. James is ordering a weak martini and being snooty about it.
Okay.
400.
You owe $400.
And you don't even need a stamp. Hand it over.
Whatever. Hand it over.
That's not quite how we see it.
Sure.
You need me?
Let's go inside. [calls] Milo, Coop, would you help Mr. Young find his pockets, please?
What happened?
It crashed?
Are there populated areas nearby?
Charlie?
Conference in the Chief with the Radiological Assistance Team.
Charlie, get me Fitzwallace, Nancy McNally, and let the senior members of the NSC know I might need them tonight.
[picks up the phone] Yeah.
Hey.
What would you have done a half hour ago that hasn't already been done?
I know. If only technology could invent some way to get in touch with you in an emergency. Some sort of telephonic device with a personalized number we could call to let you know that we needed you. Perhaps it would look something like this, Mr. Moto! [reaches into Leo's back pocket and pulls out a pager]
Would you stop?
You know I've noticed that other people keep a set of comfortable clothes in their office for when they have to work late. I like that -- you should do that too.
Oh. You should change.
Never mind.
But?
I'm pretty sure he's right.
Yeah, Leo?
I knew this a half hour ago.
This whole night I'm going to be a half hour smarter than you.
[surprised] No.
The driver's dead?
Arab?
Is that his name or is that what we think it is right now?
In what happens to be the most dangerous and unanticipated situation for the transportation of nuclear waste.
[sighs] What's that meeting next door?
Leo.
A trip to Banana Republic would have killed you? [to Leo] Let's go.
That's never been a problem for us before.
Well, that's FEMA's call, isn't it?
I should set a ransom. I'll tell you what the radiation levels are, but first I want your electoral votes. Or is that a bad strategy?
Okay, no ransom. We'll play this one straight. What about other shipments?
Have we stopped the train?
What about the second?
They beefed up the escort?
Ok.
Yup. It was the rebate.
You say potato.
We wanted to inject some money into retail and tourism.
The economy might have improved on its own by then.
Yeah.
Not that much. Most people did what you did. They saved or they paid down debt.
We do, but when the next guy's President.
I always do.
I'll tell you what I find interesting though.
You. $35,000 a year, a sister to support, and you gave $1,435 to charity. I'm not so sure that check isn't better off in your hands than ours. Oh, I'm taking it. Don't be ridiculous. But when you get to your place tonight you're going to find a new DVD player and that wimp-ass Bond movie.
And I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.
I'm really something.
Hey, John.
Yeah. Charlie, let's get that woman on the phone. I'm feeling magical tonight.
They're in the tunnel now and the readings don't show anything beyond the predictable level of background radiation. The flatbed is back on its way and the Carlsbad is behind gates so we dodged the bullet.
We packed this stuff in 2 inches of stainless steel, 4 inches of lead. We've rammed it with trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't going to protect us from the thing we haven't thought of. They took a cask out to Aberdeen Proving Ground and shot a TOW missile clean through it. They showed me video. What can I do for you?
What?
Really?
Is there anybody left who's not?
How long?
For how long have you been in recovery?
Did you say 22?
You haven't had a drink since you were 22?
I didn't start drinking till I was 25. What the hell do you guys count asâ€¦
Twenty-two?
You and James Bond ought to team up.
He's ordering a watered down martini, and Leo what the hell is this meeting that's going on all night across the hall?
Hey, did I hear right? Are you taking your name off that bill?
You're taking your name off. We can't campaign on it.
And if somebody's attacking us, you know what to do.
[goes to his desk and begins to write something] Yeah, but don't discount the possibility that it might be Leo.
John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you a little more than you thought I did, but that's not why you're staying. It's this. [hands Hoynes a piece of paper] Four words.
Just a little, right?
Me, too. Anything else?
Charlie!
Let's go. I'm a magic man.
[with Italian accent] Donnatella.
Tell Josh that General Pulaski was a Polish Brigadier General who vanquished the Russian and Prussian military then came to the colonies and commanded our cavalry during the American revolution.
It says here in a briefing paper hastily written by Deputy Josh Lyman that in the '60s when the Madison Superintendent of Schools banned Twelfth Night for reasons passing understanding, a Mrs. Molly Morello had students over to her house on Saturdays to read it.
Yeah 'cause all I had tonight was a nuclear spill in Idaho. It says she came in two hours early to teach an AP English class she developed herself because the school didn't offer one.
Sounds like she deserves a proclamation. I wish I could give her one, but I can't.
It's just too much inside baseball, you know?
Charlie, I've been tapping my finger on the desk for about a minute now.
The magic man thing works a lot better when you pick up on the signals, Tonto. What's that you say? There's a phone call for Donna?
Good evening, this is the White House, for whom are you holding?
[whispering] Tell her where you are.
[grouchily] She didn't do anything.
It's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello. I've got a few questions. When you taught Beowulf, did you make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a translation?
Okay. We're going to call that the James Bond version.
What are you planning on doing with your retirement?
I'd stay away from the Elk Horn area of Idaho for a little while. You'll read why in the morning. Let's talk about Twelfth Night.
