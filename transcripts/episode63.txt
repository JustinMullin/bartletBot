Thank you all so much. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Of what?
What's he doing here?
How big?
[takes off his glasses] What are you talking about?
That's got to be 50 million chips!
Leo, how the hell did…
That's the end of Antares.
98 thousand workers, I think 75 thousand in the US. Plus the kidney punch at NASDAQ…
Yeah.
[hurries to shake his hand] Fitz! Fitz, you old polecat, you old so-and-so!
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah.
What's the problem?
What do you use heavy water for?
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Yeah.
There's nothing we can do.
Good morning. [to Leo] Yeah, we can't do it.
That's good enough for me.
Well, Canada, Russia - roughly the same relationship with the US. Fitz, you old horse thief, you old muckety-muck!
Josh says the director of MinAtom says it's commercial power production.
Well, that's what was said by my National Security Advisor twenty minutes ago, right after it was said by the Secretaries of State and Defense. And, for what it's worth, the directors of the CIA, NSA, FBI and Naval Intelligence.
You think the Iranians forced them to build them a heavy water reactor?
Crap. And even if that were the case, it doesn't make them Jean Valjean. They want to power broker in the Middle East. Just what the doctor ordered for the Middle East.
All right, while avoiding the biggest diplomacy disaster since I don't know when - Josh, Leo, you guys have to figure out a way to get me out of it.
You're gonna get Secret Service protection, but I can't order it unless you sign this piece of paper, so sign this piece of paper.
Because Ron says it is, and around here we do whatever Ron says.
Good for you. With all your years of training and experience in sniffing out crime, your opinion really carries a lot of weight with me.
Are you kidding?
We're talking about one bodyguard. I have twelve, and that's before I leave the house. You ever count the number of guns that come along with me when Abbey and I take in a play at the Kennedy Center? Do I seem fragile to you?
Then…
I don't care.
I don't care! You're part of my family, and this thing is happening and I simply won't permit it. Sign the piece of paper.
Let me tell you something! The last time a member of my staff got a death threat, they missed him and hit me!
Yeah!
Oh man, the greatest campaign speech ever about money - FDR promises to tighten our belts. What's he do when he gets here - spends more than we knew could be spent. And it's 'cause he discovered it's better for long-term growth. [sits down to read]
Hey, I should be able to reference that speech. When did he give that? It was in the industrial North East.
Charlie, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932 in Pittsburgh, can you get your hands on a copy?
I said, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932…
Okay.
Mmm-hmmm.
How's it going?
No.
What?
[sighs] Aaaah, was wilst du von mein Leben? What do you want from my life? The government can't be in the business of cosigning loans.
[stands up] It's a subsidy.
I'm an economist!
The marketplace will take care of Antares.
That's what's supposed to happen.
That was an industry that was hurt by unfair trade practices. Antares was hurt by their own carelessness.
Unless they go under and either way they've just said 'We're open for business.'
[shouts] They were huge contributors! How the hell am I supposed… They were huge contributors!
[sits at his desk] What?
They're announcing end of business tomorrow?
[sighs] I'm not saying anything, but grab some people and put together some numbers.
I'm not saying anything.
He'll do that?
Anybody? Can I use this to get out of weddings and stuff? [sits down] Sam, the Majority Leader's gonna move up HMO reform and my Duma's gonna vote on it, what do you think?
What?
'Stem the tide" is an English idiom.
He is trying to send me a message.
[stands up] We've been trying to get non-proliferation on the agenda, we've been trying to put those exact words in Chigorin's mouth.
Fitz?
Let's go to Helsinki. But the reactor's first thing on the agenda. Anybody?
Thanks, everyone! Thank you. Thanks!
I'll be right in. Sam!
Nice job.
Tell me again why I can't wear whatever the hell I want?
I probably won't be wearing them.
Whatever happened to Pong, huh? It was great, it was relaxing, it had that very satisfying sound?
Yeah, me neither. Leo?
No. Leo wanted to see if we could guarantee a loan.
I appreciate that, and I can't give it to you, but I think I can do Leo one better.
We'll stay his biggest customer. When you announce your recall, you can announce you're keeping your government contracts. Leo will work it out with Congress.
Talk to me about the 75 thousand workers.
All right. Jakie, this is the White House, if we only screw up twice before breakfast, it was a very good morning.
One more thing: you can't make any more campaign contributions to me, or any Democrat. You can vote, but that's it.
I knew I'd get screwed by a computer one day. [Leo smiles.] I have an important photo op, excuse me. [leaves abruptly]
[approaches from behind] For the hundredth time, it was an homage!
Alan Tatum?
The White House owes you one picture.
[as they shake hands] Good to meet you!
I'm sorry. I'm married to one. No, you meant that as a good thing! Let's go.
FDR was a fine president, don't get me wrong, but if you want something done right, dammit, call New Hampshire! Come in, please.
Are you retired, Mr. Tatum?
[to Dr. Tatum] Your grandfather was a furnace worker. Your father was on a railroad. You couldn't find an honest work?
Charlie! [motions for him to come over]
Where are you going? You got pictures, what do you I get?
You were there, you were at his feet, you got to tell me everything! Sit, we're going to get some food. [to Dr. Tatum] You sit quietly over there and try to resist temptation to bill me for something.
