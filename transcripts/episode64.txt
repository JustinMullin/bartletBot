Four or five hours, maybe, you'll be fine.
They take all the Henrys. They do a thing, they call it War of the Roses. I'm told by those who saw it in London it's spectacular. Catholic charities bought out a Broadway theater. We're gonna go, we're gonna make some money.
You know why? Cause the Royal National Company's got all the King Henrys up there and I'm still number one at the box office.
Let me as you something, which Plantagenet do I most remind you of?
Good morning.
We just got done with Helsinki and the reactor.
How do we know?
General?
So order it. I don't care if we know anything new or not, I need updates every half hour for the next 48 hours.
It's Henry V, three Henry VI, and Henry VIII.
What does that mean? It sounds modern.
Well, that doesn't sound bad.
Let me ask you something.
If Shakespeare wrote a play about me, how many parts do you think it would be?
Think about it.
What are we doing?
We're leaning on Arab Intelligence sources?
We're leaning on them?
I'm not going to the bunker.
I'm not going to the bunker. It sends a terrible sign. I'm sitting in this room.
You haven't been through it with me.
You're telling me that the Secret Service, you're telling me my own bodyguards are gonna escort me to the bunker?
Yeah.
This doesn't mean anything to me.
Where?
Are we able to take a guess at where and when now?
[sighs] What about Abdul Shareef? Isn't Shareef supposed to be helping us with intelligence out of Qumar?
Thank you.
I'm not going to the bunker. There are going to be people who aren't going to the bunker, and when I get out I'm not going to be able to tell them what to do anymore and I like doing that. Let's get Abby to New Hampshire but I'm not going to the bunker. And if you say I have to I'm walking across the alley with the Chief Justice and I'm handing John Hoynes my resignation. And as soon as he's sworn in I'm telling him to appoint me his Vice President because I'm not going to the bunker. If the agent's come, the agents come but tell Ron he'd better bring more than a couple of guys.
You can send him in.
Oakland, California.
What did they find on board?
What was the target?
That wasn't on the list.
So why'd they want it.
The Golden Gate Bridge.
This was on the west coast and we didn't know anything.
I'm going to ask this again. Where the hell was Shareef?
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
To who ?
Are you telling me the Qumari defence minister may have ordered an attack on the Golden Gate Bridge?
We have a diplomatic relationship with this country.
He's coming here. Shareef is coming here, in like, ten days, isn't he?
Get ready to say.
Thank you.
