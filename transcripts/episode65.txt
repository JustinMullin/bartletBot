[sighs] You haven't got it.
We want to ask the Justice Department to indict Qumari Minister of Defense. We're saying he's a terror kingpin. We're saying he's killed I don't know how many civilians and how many of Tommy's Marines. We're saying he's compromised I don't know how many agents throughout the world and we're saying he's done it in the clothing of an ally. This isn't a cave dweller. This is Capone. You haven't got it.
[to the grave] I've been seeing a shrink, by the way. I had trouble sleeping and Leo brought in a guy. I feel ridiculous talking out loud like this, but he said… Doesn't matter. I just can't believe it's been a year. Anyway.
What is it?
What is it?
Leo.
[reads]'The enemy imagines he is secure. The bridge did not fall. He looks down from his high-- or elevated place or places-- but our great victory is still assured. There will be other moments.
'I have brought him low, and I will do it again.' [takes off glasses] All right.
This is ridiculous. He's coming here. He's coming here! Why the hell can't we arrest him when he steps off the plane?
Fitz makes a reasonable point. Doesn't it pretty much go without saying that I revoked it after he tried to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge?
Why the hell do we need…? He's coming here on his own. He's delivering himself on a Lear jet.
Fellas, this guy is going to stand trial in a US court and if we have to stick heroin on his plane to get him there, that's what we're going to do.
It should be a showcase. He should have the best lawyers in the world.
Why?
The law cracks me up.
What else?
You suppose that could be any more patronizingly named?
What do they want me to eat?
Ah, the marriage incentives. What a bunch of horse manure.
Is marriage really something that should be incentivised? And where the hell are all the small government conservatives when we're talking about Washington getting into the yenta business?
You think we should do it?
Marriage incentives. Used to be all you had to have was a decent dental practice.
I'm erudite.
Lets do it.
Charlie.
I appreciated you coming out to the cemetery with me yesterday.
So it's been a year. Why don't you organize the search, you know for a new Executive Secretary.
I may not like the first couple of candidates. It may take a while.
Thank you.
[comes in] They've got something for us.
Did we solve immunity?
Did we solve it?
Why?
Yeah.
He was tortured?
Well, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that's inadmissible.
We'll come up with a less aggressive way of… We'll cancel his trip here obviously, but we'll come up with something. That's the ball game.
Josh, what the hell did you do to this welfare vote?
Why?
I'm going to that.
I know.
The fund-raiser was my idea. I've known the Archbishop for 20 years and I'm not playing politics with the church. Did anyone want to ask me abut this? You've got me running the vote from the mezzanine floor of a Broadway theatre. Where are we in the vote?
We are?
Why?
[angrily] True or false, Josh: My life would be better right now if you and your girlfriend swapped jobs? Why is it for every good thing you do around here, we've got to endure three screwiest.
Sorry doesn't get me 218. It doesn't get back the ad that slipped through your office any more then it gets back tobacco which you gave away for lunch money. And why the hell don't you know what Ritchie's commitments are before you get anywhere near my schedule? I've got the Presidential Box at a cattle call. Win the damn vote.
I've got a G-8 briefing.
What are you doing here? It's 1:00 in the morning.
You were home?
You came over here to stand in front of Josh?
Why?
What are you…
Maybe.
More counsel is going to help me violate international law.
It's pretty easy to say anything is a war scenario.
The war on poverty. It's a slippery slope.
What?
There are moral absolutes.
Il Principe has justified every act of oppression…
Says who?
Well, a mob mentality is just…
There are moral absolutes. Make the call.
