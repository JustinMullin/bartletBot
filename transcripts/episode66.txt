Hello.
There are rules for these things?
Doesn't the law also require that I not assassinate someone?
I know. One of them was mine.
Assume for a second I say yes. How do we do it? Fitz walks up to him with a gun?
Why?
The things we choose to care about.
If it can't happen here, then why'd we care that Shareef was delivering himself?
The British say yes?
How many over there know about this?
And some people in Bermuda?
[uneasily] Okay. Well… surely, this is the most absurd meeting I ever sat in, and friends, that is saying something.
Yeah, I imagine.
What does the pen do? Squirts poison?
We give him it boxed. Tell them to put it in a box.
It's "The War of the Roses." All the Henrys, and all the Richards, for that matter.
Yeah.
Yeah. There's also singing.
No, but they're gonna sing from time to time, and one of the songs is a song I love. I can't think of the name now, but it's an Edwardian… It always reminds me… It makes me think of college, like, I don't know, like they should be singing it in the dining hall at Christ College at Cambridge. The chorus is, "And victorious in war shall be made glorious in peace." I was just singing it this morning.
Good. Yeah. Let me ask you something. Is there a crime, which if it wasn't illegal, you would do?
Right, but you wouldn't rob a bank?
Connecticut had a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. It was written out of rage against adultery. But in the age of AIDS, don't Connecticut residents do more for the general welfare by flagrantly breaking the law?
Yeah.
Stanley…
I can't tell you.
No, I really can't. It's high security. To say nothing of… [sighs heavily]
If I tell you I intend to commit a crime, you're required by law to report it. [beat] I have a strange meeting coming up. [beat] I'm gonna go. It's good seeing you.
[indicating the men by the door] Who are these men?
Okay.
Yeah, I'm feeling particularly proud of that today.
We're happy you visited us, Mr. Defense Minister. You're welcome here anytime, and please, send the best regards of the President of the United States to the Royal Sultan.
Not in the Oval Office.
Tell him I have a rash on my hand. Make sure you apologize.
Yeah. [to the translator] Thanks.
It's a hand-carved incense burner. Gypsum and sandalwood.
It's Fiderer?
[while signing papers] I saw your resume, so we don't need to talk about that. What have you been doing recently?
Like the sweaters?
Uh-huh. And before that?
You're a professional gambler.
Whereabouts?
Okay. Why did you leave the White House?
Charlie!
Can I have a minute?
[to Ms. Fiderer] Would you mind waiting outside just a moment?
[to Charlie] Is this a joke? If it's a joke, it's both funny and well-executed, but I think you and I both know that it's not. I send you out to replace Delores Landingham, and that's what you came home with?
She was an alpaca farmer who needed two tries to get her own name.
Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get the Personnel Office on it. I got to go change for New York.
What's going on?
From this afternoon?
Are you pledging a fraternity or something, 'cause this would be a good one.
What's with you and this woman?
Civilians get trials.
They're gonna find out it's us. We could make it look like the plane went down, but they're gonna find out it's us, and I'm gonna be running for reelection while I'm fighting a war against Qumar.
I want him tried.
I understand.
Yeah.
What do you want from me?
This isn't a matter of religion.
I recognize that there's evil in the world.
Doesn't this mean we join the league of ordinary nations?
That's not my objection.
It's just wrong. It's absolutely wrong.
Why?
Take him.
[smiling] Caught me.
Governor.
I am. How about you?
Yeah, I know. Listen, politics aside, and I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but you probably insulted the church, and you can head it off at the pass if you speak to the Cardinal tonight.
No.
Yeah. [beat] No, I don't understand that. The center fielder for the Yankees is an accomplished classical guitarist. People who like baseball can't like books?
No. Something horrible happened about an hour ago.
C.J. Cregg was getting threats so we put an agent on her. He's a good guy. He was on my detail for a while, and he was in Rosslyn. He walked in the middle of an armed robbery, and was shot and killed after detaining one of the suspects.
[sighs] We should have a great debate, Rob. We owe it to everyone. When I was running as a governor, I didn't know anything. I made them start Bartlet college in my dining room. Two hours every morning on foreign affairs and the military. You can do that.
I wasn't, Rob. But you've turned being un-engaged into a Zen-like thing, and you shouldn't enjoy it so much is all, and if it appears at times as if I don't like you, that's the reason why.
They're playing my song.
In the future, if you're wondering, "Crime. Boy, I don't know" is when I decided to kick your ass.
