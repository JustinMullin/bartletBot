You know the story about…
There's a guy down here holding a sign that says, "Eight more years." Don't get me wrong, I like your thinking, but I've probably tested the Constitution about as far as Abbey's going to allow me to for a little while. [Crowd cheers and applauds.] You know the story about the guy whose cars gets stuck in a muddy hole. A farmer comes along and says he'll pull the car out of the mud but he's going to have to charge 50 bucks 'cause this is the tenth time he's had to pull it out of the mud today. The driver says, "God, when to you have time to plow your land, at night?" The farmer says, "No, no. Nighttimeis when I fill the whole with water." [Crowd laughs.] We need to find energy alternatives. We're getting our cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy. They're trying to convince us that they care about new energy and that they're not in the vest pockets of big oil, and that's a tough sell. I don't envy them, 'cause their only hope is that we don't notice that they're the ones who are filling the hole with water every night, and I think Americans are smarter then that. I think we noticed.
This isn't a time for people whose doomsday scenario is a little less at the pump for Texaco and Shell. This isn't a time for people who say there aren't any energy alternatives, just because they can't think of any. This is a time for American heros, and we reach for the stars.
Captain, good to see you.
Good morning.
They had exposure in the fund?
I'm amazed it's only down 270.
That's what you want to say to me?
Driscoll announced it was filling, and Jennings and DWA were in the fund.
It's against the law to campaign on a military base.
No, legally.
These army guys are DRF-1. They're division ready. They can be deployed in two hours. These navy guys are going to deploy overseas for six months.
C- bag and M-16, they're on a C-130 going where ever I tell them. And that's when their wives are told. I don't want to screw around with them.
Yeah.
Good morning. We haven't meet. I'm your Commander in Chief.
This is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, and I want to tell you why.
So what will I remember? What will I tell my grandchildren? I'll tell them that I stood on the Great Wall of China, and that I stood in the well of the U.S. House of Representitives. I'll tell them that I sat with kings and cardinals and made an appointment to the Supreme Court, and I'll tell them that one morning in September I got to spend a few minutes with the men and women of Air Wing One. God bless you and your families and may he continue to shed his magnificent grace upon the United States of America.
How's it going?
It feels good.
Jennings-Pratt was in the fund?
It'll rebound.
No kidding, it feels good out here.
What are you doing?
About what?
You don't meet with Fitzwallace about nothing.
What?
Leo…
Yeah, all right. Well, we're coming home now.
It's still mostly transportation and technology?
Have Josh and Toby weigh in at some point, okay?
Yeah?
Come on in. Nice to meet you.
I's crazy I know, but sometimes the schedule gets so tight that we have to schedule meetings on the plane, so we ask you to fly with us and hit you on the way back.
Were you impressed by the plane?
It's got an apartment and an operating room.
Okay. Well, you've met with Donald McKittridge-- he directs the Office of Presidential Personnel.
You had a moment to meet with Charlie Young?
He's probably mentioned that this was a job where you to need to be able to hold a lot of names and dates and numbers in your head.
You were told what the pay scale was?
And some of the perks?
Well, for instance, we have our own 747, and it's flown by an Air Force general.
Okay, let's talk about your last job.
There's a tremendous amount of informatin you need to keep track of: dates, names, number, things I'm not good with.
What's that?
It's not intellect, it's memory. It's a different gift. A wonderful one. I've never had it.
Well… okay, I'll try and find that time, but let's get back to you. What would you say was the most challenging part of working for the Ambassador of France?
Mm.
I make fun of the French as much as anybody and I don't even know what that meant.
Nah, that's okay. I think you're terrific and I appreciate your coming in and talking to us.
Thanks again.
Yeah. Hey.
Please, the market's down 425 points.
I know.
425 points represents billions of dollars which aren't there anymore heading into the fourth quarter which is Christmas.
What's your good news?
You said almost all.
Why does Gallup have it a one-point race?
Well, one day I'll buy you a beer and you'll tell us all how you did it.
Seth Weinberger's assistant has come forward with the information that he was having an affair with a colleague and a newspaper has printed it.
You tell me. He'd already stepped down over OSHA. It's been two months. This is an assistant getting her name in the paper and it's unbelievably hurtful to his wife. I don't understand it. I don't understand the paper printed it either, but that's another day. This is terrible.
Good.
Hmm?
Mitch, come on in. [to Sam] Just rock and roll, Sam.
Hey.
We have your input. You're talking about the exemption.
Developing nations, and I think what's lunacy is a nation of SUV's telling a nation of bicycles, that they have to change the way the live before we'll agree to do something about greenhouse emission.
Well, in international law there's a principle called differentiated responsibilties. We're the ones making the greenhouse gas!
Mr. Secretary, it's not your job to tell me whose support I'm losing. We have people who do that. It's your job to tell me whose support you just got for me.
Okay.
[to Larry] Ed.
Whatever. Seth Weinberger's old assistant…
I don't think a lot of blind loyalty, but I think a lot less of blind betrayal.
Yeah, that's probably why.
Could somebody get Leo for me, please? Peter, you hear that? He called you "congressman."
You think when your folks got you out in '74, they imagined they were taking you to a place that'd be willing to make you a Congressman?
Me too. How's fishing?
You catch any marlin?
Takes a fisherman to catch one, though, right?
Okay, I'm just saying.
Leo, meet Congressman Peter Lien, Texas 22nd. Peter, this is Leo McGarry, U.S. Air Force, 144th Fighter Wing.
Peter's family fishes in Galveston Bay, but they don't catch marlin. It's a sore spot, and he doesn't like to talk about it. Peter's 34 years old.
Ordinarily I would tell you that Jim Coor was a good public servant, and you've got big shoes to fill, and he was and you do, but obviously you have a bigger symbolic responsibilty then that.
But you biggest responsibiltity isn't symbolic, right?
What is it?
Welcome, my freind, to the show that never ends.
Isn't that a hell of a thing? What's next?
