Yeah, it's a proud day for Alfred Nobel.
When do you think I say something?
Tell me again.
Mr. Kieth.
I told my granddaughter I was meeting you and I asked what question she wanted me to ask you and she said to ask you of all the presidents you've met, who is your favorite and I assured her that it would be me.
Okay, well, I was just kidding, but, sure Truman, if you like that kind of thing.
How old were you when you met President Hoover?
The 23rd?
No, no. It's just… it's… You shook hands with him, and next day the Great Depression started.
Okay. Stock market took a stumble today. You know, we'll call it… well, a little bigger than a pre-rally decline. If you watch the news or read a newspaper or really are alive in any way, you're going to hear about it in the next couple of hours. I'm not worried though, 'cause Tokyo opens at 7:00 PM Eastern and Tokyo's going to be my mother's milk tonight. It's in the bag.
No.
I'm sorry. Sorry, could I just have one second? Charlie?
How you doing?
[as he and Charlie step to the window] There's a lot of science in economics to be sure but like a lot of things, a lot depends on the user. I need the Nikkei Index to do what I need it to do tonight and I've got Hoover's good luck charm over here. But now, while I'm talking about it, I feel like it's ridiculous that someone like me would consider canceling a photo-op…
I'm not, it's momentary.
Really?
I didn't know you were superstitious.
No.
Charlie, just out of curiosity, in your mind, how much time do I spend thinking about your desk?
How long have we been talking about this now?
Okay, let's not tell anybody that.
Just scheduling.
Thank you.
You can't say "faith-based initiatives" to me. You have to be more specific then that. You can't offer a guy a hot meal but first you have to accept God into your heart. It's against the law. It's also a little obnoxious.
No, the soup is non-denominational, Fred but I'm not talking about the soup I'm talking about the programs. And another problem is, the government can't subsidize organizations that discriminate in hiring practices as religious organizations are allowed to do.
We're going to talk about it around her, but I wouldn't…
Okay.
I met with two women this morning on the plane. I'm meeting another in a little bit.
No.
Well, the first one isn't easily impressed.
She told me. The second one wasn't funny.
Or rather, didn't think I was.
She was the secretary to an Ambassador to France. I told her that I'd had dinner with D'Astier at the Elysee Palace. She gently corrected me at that point calling it the Palais de l'Elysee-- for that alone I wanted to sent for a parachute. And I made a joke to D'Astier having to do with cheese and I said that D'Astier was visibly insulted and that he was reconsidering my diplomatic status and she said, "Well, did he?"
It didn't bode well for me.
A… crazy woman that Charlie knows. Hey, do we have a GPS reading out on Josh and Toby? Have they been sighted?
300 IQ points between them-- they can't find their way home. I swear to God, if Donna wasn't there, they'd have to buy a house. "You've got to be able to keep a lot of names and numbers in your head. Can you do that?" "Oh, I should think so." Oh, should you? Okay, well, I'm going interview a few more people, in the meantime, you can get your ass back on the cover of the The New Yoker where it belongs.
A third one. Charlie say that I don't want anyone to replace her.
I don't know, Sam. I'm a puzzle.
This Seth Weinberger thing makes me crazy.
Well, it's an election year, Bill. We'd rather people didn't exercise common sense but I agree with what you're saying.
Yes?
Really?
All right.
Hi.
You two know each other?
You're the alpaca farmer
You hired Charlie, huh?
I didn't know that.
Well, thanks for that.
Who was in second place? Who did I almost get?
I like to think about the road not taken.
Yeah.
David Dweck?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Sorry. Why were you fired?
Why were you fired?
That doesn't sound quite right.
Why were you fired?
Only because you're asking for a job.
I don't belive you.
No, it's not.
Yes.
Charlie said it was because of him.
He said you hired him and that's why you got fired.
No he doesn't.
I'm now ordering you to tell me why you were fired.
You were strange the first time I met you, and you're strange now.
What?
Okay.
Tell me why you were fired.
I'm going to figure it out anyway. What I lack in memory, I more than make up for with exceptional powers of deductive reasoning.
All right. I think the interview's over.
Thank you very much.
Brian Dweck, CFO of Colfax and contributor to Representative Mark McKittridge whose brother is the Director of the White House Office of Presidenial Personnel, wants a job for his son, David-- "Wants a Dwink of WaWa." My powers of deduction are not to be mocked.
She didn't tell me anything. I ordered her to, and she… By the way, my powers of ordering are a joke. I can create an agency, but I can't get her to… She didn't give you up. She, um… she didn't give you up.
Have the agents stop her at the door a second.
Debbie.
Where's the dollar?
What's the dollar doing right now?
Bring her on.
Is the Frist Lady inside?
Suppertime.
Medea, you home?
"Political experts seemed surprised by the Bartlet campaigns decision to position their candidate against motherhood. Said one spokesperson…"
What?
No, don't do this.
About what?
How?
[genuinely touched] What the hell are you… It was benign. It was totally benign what you said. These women are out of their minds. We're laughing about it here.
I'm telling… Turn on C.J.'s press briefing. She's been doing 20 minutes up there. They're booking her into Ceasar's.
No.
Ah, you pulled the switcheroo.
You deceived me.
You played upon my love for you.
Yeah. I hired someone today.
Yeah.
Her name is Debbie Fiderer. She used to work here.
Used to be DiLaGuardia.
Yeah.
She doesn't scare you a little?
[beat] No. Okay, I'm getting dressed for the thing.
Yeah.
…restoring abundance amid an economic shortfall, securing peace in a time of global conflict, sustaining hope in this winter of anxiety and fear. More than any time in recent history, America's destiny is not of our own choosing. We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedom and our way of life. We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil. Yet the true measure of a people's strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arive. 44 people were killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State University. Three swimmers from the men's team were killed and two others are in critical condition. When, after having heard the explosion from their practice facility, they ran into the fire to help get people out. Ran into the fire. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight. They're our students and our teachers and our parents and our friends. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels, but every time we think we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and we're reminded that that capacity may well be limitless. this is a time for American heroes. We will do what is hard We will achieve what is great. This is a time for American heroes and we reach for the stars. God bless their memory, God bless you and God bless the United State of America. Thank you.
The happy fun group.
They're just allowed to make things up now?
They know it was us right?
Is that what you think we should do?
Yeah.
What about you?
I signed a piece of paper, Fitz.
You just hated my living guts when I got this job, didn't you?
Yeah, you did. I didn't know anything and I didn't have any respect for the Chiefs. You became my counselor and you wrangled the Chiefs and you brought them to me.
You brought them to me. And you talked Leo into Shareef and he talked me into it. It was my order and you executed it flawlessly and I stand by it. I stand by you, I stand by you all. I stand by it till I die. Plus, I'm going to need some cell mates in Holland. So, what do we do now?
Let's go.
