She's not worried about the length of your question, she's worried about the length of my response.
We're having salmon tonight.
They told you that?
Yo-yo Ma is going to play. [No answer.] Some Bach concertos, I believe. [Still no answer.] Do you like salmon?
Well… our mistake.
She'd like you to say a little more on the subject.
Okay.
Which one?
I try not to look out my window that much, Danny. What protestors?
Vermeil?
Thank you.
Leo…
Absolutely.
[to Siguto] Would you pardon me one moment, please? [to reporters] Excuse me, folks.
I can't decide if that man is boring or rude, but he's one or the other.
I'm sitting out there trying to figure out how this guy campaign for something and win, then I remembered--we usually rig the elections.
You think it's important he sit at my table tonight?
Where are you sitting?
Where's Toby sitting?
Ah, that's the fun table.
What do you need?
Because of the hurricane?
All right, fine.
Sorry to keep you waiting. [No answer.] Did I mention we're having salmon tonight?
No, of course not.
You want to raid this house?
All right, Mandy. Thank you. Josh? Would you two give us a minute, please?
Without warning?
The hurricane just shifted direction without any warning?
I would think.
Captain? How big is this carrier group? How many men and how many ships?
How soon before the worst of it starts?
Is there any way I can speak with the fleet commander?
All right. Let's do it.
Thank you.
Any word on the FBI guy's condition?
What do I do now?
How are we doing?
Hungry?
Tired?
Talk to me for five minutes apiece and then we're going to settle this.
Stay standing.
Time's up.
Yes, I know. But I got tired of listening to you. Now you listen to me. I have a Nobel Prize in Economics and I'm here to tell you that none of you know what the hell you're talking about. At 12:01 am, I'm using my executive power to nationalize the trucking industry.
Fourteen White House lawyers disagree. Truman did it in '52 with the coalmine.
In 50 years, there's a new bench and I'll take my chances. As for Labor, I am calling Congress into Emergency Session to grant me the authority to draft the truckers into military service. You're going to love our food. Nice talking to you folks. If this isn't settled in 47 minutes, don't worry. We know where to find you. [walks out]
Hey… I'm all right. [holds her hands]
I approved a plan for an FBI negotiator.
He's in surgery now.
What the hell? Well, if this isn't a metaphor for powerlessness, I don't know what is. We better get back to work, huh?
We got the fleet commander?
So, I guess I'm going to talk to the Captain of the Hickory?
Is there somebody on there now? [points to the radio]
You're kidding.
Hello? [pause] Hello? Anyone there?
Hickory, this is the White House. Who am I speaking to?
Son? This is President Bartlet. [No answer.] Hello?
Is your C.O. around?
Can I talk to you in the meantime? [beat] Hello?
Are you all right, Harold?
Are you bleeding?
Can you put something on it?
You go over and get it. I'll stay right here.
Harold? [pause] Harold, are you back?
Can you tell us what's going on?
Harold?
We're here.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Well, I don't know, man. Sounds pretty bad, Harold. I think I'm going to ask for my money back. [pause] Harold?
I'm going to stay right here, as long as the radio works, okay?
Hang on.
