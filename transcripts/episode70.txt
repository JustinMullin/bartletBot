Nancy's in her office. There are some calls I asked her to make.
Listen, I know we're here for a serious purpose, for a sober purpose, but I wanted to say I've never been a part of a street gang before, and that's basically what we are -- a pretty well-financed one -- but anyway, I wanted to say it feels good, and I think when we're done with this meeting, I think we should go out and get girls, and I don't know, maybe knock over a fruit stand or something.
We're going to need to learn to sing and dance.
Toby and Josh are back. Toby Ziegler and Josh Lyman missed the motorcade in Indiana yesterday. It's taken them 20 hours to get home. They're walking into DC right now.
You're not curious why they're walking into DC?
Walking into DC from where I guess you got to ask.
Okay, just for that, when it comes time to give out gang nicknames, you're going to be… I don't know, but you're not going to have a good nickname.
Ellie had a teacher named Mr. Pordy, who had no interest in nuance. He asked the class why there's always been conflict in the Middle East and Ellie raised her hand and said, "It's a centuries old religious conflict involving land and suspicions and culture and…" "Wrong." Mr. Pordy said, "It's because it's incredible hot and there's no water." (to Leo) I'm hunkered down. I'm going to East Lansing. We're going to need a lawyer.
I don't know. It's a seven-ten split. Can you work on it a while?
I'm going to call Leo. I'll be in my office.
[on phone] How's it going?
Is she there?
Casper's here, he's going to talk to me. I'll send him to you next, all right?
I don't know. I still have about two minutes.
"The bullying nature of the intrusive and invasive government of the United States has to be rendered quickly and decisively a wake-up call. And this opportunity…" What do you think of this letter?
No.
Is it credible?
You guys think it was sent by the bomber?
We think there's a group.
The end of the letter promises more.
Unless what? That's where I'm confused.
All right, what do you have?
Yes, plus once we catch a perpetrator, you don't need to track him down.
I think I'm just going to talk for a little bit.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you. "Joy cometh in the morning," scripture tells us. I hope so. I don't know if life would be worth living if it didn't. And I don't yet know who set off the bomb at Kennison State. I don't know if it's one person or ten, and I don't know what they want. All I know for sure, all I know for certain, is that they weren't born wanting to do this. There's evil in the world. There'll always be, and we can't do anything about that. But there's violence in our schools, too much mayhem in our culture and we can do something about that. There's not enough character, discipline, and depth in our classrooms. There aren't enough teachers in our classrooms. [applause] There isn't nearly enough, not nearly enough, not nearly enough money in our classrooms, and we can do something about that. We're not doing nearly enough, not nearly enough to teach our children well. And we can do better, and we must do better, and we will do better. And we will start this moment today! They weren't born wanting to do this.
What else?
What's wrong with that?
Oh, for the love of Mike.
Look, win or lose on the 5th, I'm the President right now, right?
Six -- look, six of the girls were exactly Zoey's age. Tell the Chancellor's office that if it'll make his life easier, I'll sit in row 19 and you'll keep out the press. This has to be about the students and the families, and Ritchie and I are simply going to have to summon the humanity to keep this from being a political event.
How did you do with Jordan?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right. In the meantime, what do we do have by way of stalling tactics?
We ought to be good at that.
State thinks he had a friendly relationship with the West.
Shareef is now alive and well and living in Libya?
All right. Come back and tell me how we do it.
Blind men. "The one-eyed man is king in a world of blind men."
Yes, please.
What do you know?
The internet has been a phenomenal tool for hate groups.
Don't pipe bombs usually kill two or three people?
How is it so many yesterday?
No. Thanks.
Ten of those under the bleachers at a basketball game?
Okay.
Charlie?
In ascending order of age, would you get my daughters on the phone, please?
Thank you.
What's going on?
Allergy medicine?
Tractor starter fluid doesn't kill you?
You think these might be our guys?
We have reason to believe they're connected KSU?
Are there kids inside?
All right. Let's get the Director and the Attorney General. We only go in on my order, okay? It'll be my order.
You just knew it was going to end up like this.
Allergy medicine and tracker fluid we're getting high on now.
Is this going to get ridiculuos?
We'll see it Al Jazeera?
No disinformation to U.S. press, right? We don't give disinformation to the American press? Unless it's about my health?
All right, let's go.
All this posturing is a preamble to something.
Why not?
Hey Jordan.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Yeah.
That makes three of us.
Take all the time you want. You done yet?
Well, that makes us ground-breaking, doesn't it?
More ground-breaking.
Due respect, Ms. Kendall, I'm the last person to whom that needs to be pointed out. And Article 51 of the United Nations charter says every nation has a right to wage war to defend itself.
Wars don't work like that anymore.
44 people are dead in Iowa, and most them college kids. Shareef has murdered Americans in uniform. He's murdered Americans out of uniform. He was trying to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge, and I didn't have time to file an amicus brief.
I don't know, I'm working on that.
Why?
Well, that's what I was hoping you'd say. I want there to be justice. That's why I'm talking to lawyer. Anyway, I just came in to say hello.
Charlie?
I'm heading back to the residence.
Oh, God. Yeah.
Arsenic?
No.
Why couldn't you have stopped with "I sincerely apologize?"
Your argument is totally fuhkakta by the way. The World Bank has a $17 billion budget contributed by a hundred… Uh, it doesn't matter. Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
You can keep the job.
Why, because you knock me out, that's why.
"Let's stick some arsenic into President Bartlet's drinking water and see if he delegates responsibility to the World Bank then." President Bartlet. You reffered to me and to the office with respect. You're a class act.
[on his way out] Whack job.
