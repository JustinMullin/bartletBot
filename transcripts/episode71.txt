Treasury scored it?
OMB says it's revenue nuetral?
NEC, DPC, the advisors?
Joint tax on the Hill?
All right. All right. Let's line up validators.
Yeah?
And update our resumes.
What? You're doing the face.
They've always been iffy about me in Maine. I don't know why.
Heroin addicts?
Whatever. Let's worry about if Stackhouse does something.
Anything else?
Why do we think the boy is sick?
How do you do it?
Why?
You hear that?
Where's the table?
All right. We should do it. Let's get the kid. Good luck, everybody. Good luck, Casper.
What's going on?
Leo, they did it.
Casper's boys.
One suspect… you should tell him.
Wounded in the leg. That's it.
Our guys are fine.
And? Come on, and…
He's…
Univerisy Hospital. Stable condition. Mike, pick yourself out a daughter. My oldest is married, but I can have it annulled. The Pope said he'd do it, I swear to God.
Jerry, ws that note anything I need?
Where did it originate?
Okay. Somebody will keep me posted.
Mike? No kidding, thank you.
Yeah, call that play on first down again, Coach 'cause I'm sure they're not ready for it this time. You know, if you ask a professional athlete what the hardest thing is to do in sports, they'll all say "hit a baseball." But a coach once told me that the hardest thing to do in sports is to walk into your Super Bowl locker room at half-time and change the strategy that got you there 'cause it's no longer working.
It's not even the number of debates, as much as the format. 2 minute response followed by a 1 minute reply. That's not a debate. That's not a debate! It's a joint press conference.
Nice job on the Red Mass. First rate.You don't mind if I change everything, do you?
Here… here… and I added a section here.
It's a joint press conference. It's not neccesary for the candidates to be in the same room. That part's just theater.
Be nice to be able to respond to what the other person has said, and ask them a question. And the moderator should be empowered to press for an answer, just as a judge can of a witness, or a member of Congress in a confirmation hearing.
Cicero wanted to restore the overthrown king of Egypt, and the Roman Senate debated all day and into the night, every military and diplomatic consequence until they collapsed on the Senate floor. Lentulus is trying to overthrow the Republic. Ceaser goes up against Cato-- by the way, in the very first public debate on the death penalty. They were against each other, it was a debate and they explored the meaning of spirituality and suffering.
That's right, but my point…
Why not, what?
We'd never get it.
The Ritchie people wold put up too much of a fight.
Other then this House, we don't have anything else they want.
Wow. Isn't this exactly why casino's don't play with a one-deck shoe?
Hmm…
He's still running that screen pass. Get Toby to sign off, and I'm in.
This is going to be interesting. Do I need my speech?
And so how isn't it a Constitutional issue? It is, but sometimes you say, "Big deal." It was the intention not to have a national religion, not to have anyone's religious views imposed on anyone else, and not to have the government encourage a national display of piety as a substitute for real action. I'll be in the office a minute.
Thank you. I didn't write much of it.
That part I wrote. I added it.
You did, Howard. You did all the time.
No. C.J.?
Would it be possible to move the press off the church grounds? I'm going to take questions for a little while.
Needle exchange.
