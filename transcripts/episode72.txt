Affirmative action and quotas are about two different things. Affirmative action is about providing people an opportunity they might not otherwise get.
What that hell is…? I don't support racial profiling.
Why?
'Cause bite me, that's why.
It's been almost four years Sam, how long do you want to say "I told you so?"
What wrong with "bite me?"
I think she was talking to me there, Dexter. What?
I'm against it.
How you doing there Joey? Kippy?
Okay.
Is that what you were saying, Andy?
I do know what my position is.
Excuse me…
Were you doing me just then?
You were doing me.
Anybody else do a pretty good Bartlet? It's talent night here at Debate Camp, anybody want to do a little skit?
Apparently, eight Israeli Thunder fighters--these are also known as American-made Boeing F15E Strike Eagles--have hit two terrorist bases in the north and south of Qumar. And while no Qumari government personel or institutions were destroyed, Qumar, of course, considers an attack on its soil to be an act of war. So we are, as always, one bad bottle of Tequila away from all-out war in West Asia. (to Sam) Would you like to take this one or shall I?
Okay.
(leaving room) I agreed to be locked up with you people for 48 hours. How much time do I have left?
Defense condition three for the bases in Qumar is what?
What's happening on the ground?
That was fast.
Alright. Well, we've got ourselves a Marx Brothers' movie.
You have the order. Oh, Fitz.
How're you doing?
Well, we've made camp in North Carolina for prep, so I've been thinking about killing myself, but let me ask you something. Besides Qumar, Iran, Syria, Hezbullah, they've all got short and medium-range missiles. If Israel feels threatened by them, what happens?
Well, for the moment, they haven't stood up, but in the meantime, let's think of something we can give them when they do.
(warning tone) Leo…
Honey, if we're going to have this fight, can we not do it in front of the Joint Chiefs? It just scares the hell out of them.
Mr. Chairman, would you put our bases in Qumar at Defense Condition 3 with the U.S. Military at Defcon Four?
Thank you.
(enters) We got Rooker.
Well, that's an extraordinary and unsurprisingly dumb interpretation of what it is my administration's trying to accomplsh.
It's hard enought to rasie kids today with help from family leave, subsidized daycare, preschool-- we need more of it, not less.
I have three grown daughters, Governor. You really want to tell me how I should raise my family? You're really comfortable with that?
You want to tell other American fathers and mothers what they're doing wrong?
I didn't think you did. So, why don't we stick to what government can do-- which is collect money and distribute it-- and stop wasting time by sentimentalizing family.
Who are you now?
That wasn't the question, Larry. The question was, "What do I have against families?" and the answer is I have nothing against them at all.
They simply aren't mentioned in the Executive Powers section.
It's nice.
What are we doing right now?
They'll loan stuff?
Really?
I want Apollo 11.
Then don't bother me.
I'm meeting with the leadership, I'm signing six Executive Orders I don't yet understand…
God, I thought that was a closet.
All right, the rooms got four doors, it's huge.
Do you understand them?
C.J., what are you doing?
[points to Leo] He's standing right there.
Would you get your ass in here? Could everyone stop acting strange?
Yeah.
Law enforcement?
It's our second day, how do you think it's going so far?
Yes.
Thanks for coming down.
They turn around the ship in exchange for what?
They're arming the Bahji, Leo. Two training camps of which the Israelis just attacked. I've gotta turn around the boat-- tonight. Tomorrow we'll worry about tomorrow.
Look…
Fitz?
What about Nancy?
What's available from the Sixth Fleet?
Stop the boat. Don't shoot it unless I tell you to.
Hey.
Did you have a good day?
You know what I remember he said to me? He said, "Mr. President, when I hear black footsteps behind me, I'm scared. When I hear white footsteps, I'm not."
You pay for these things for such a long time. Too long, don't you think?
We made a mistake… I corrected it. I'll make more.
Am I going to lose New Hampshire?
I don't mind blowing the knucklehead stuff like Rooker… Rooker's not knucklehead, but… if I'm making mistakes there, how do I know I'm not doing it when it comes to matters like death and destruction?
All right. When we're done tonight, we should talk about moving money to Ohio.
Not anymore. He's dead.
Let's go.
And stay up in my face, okay?
I swear to God, the winner of this debate's going to be the next President. Anybody want to be on the losing team?
Then let's pump it up. Let's go, Claudia Jean.
