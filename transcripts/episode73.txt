Ten words. Ten words.
All right, let's do a drill.
Too much money for too little protection.
Next.
That would offer some children a choice of better schools, but I haven't given up the ghost on better schools for everybody, and vouchers drain money from that goal.
First of all, it's important to understand the President doesn't make that decision, though he appoints the Supreme Court Justices who do so. What… any… um… All right, I'm not going to say that. I'll just go right to… No, I don't. I think you know that I'm opposed…. [sighs] Let's not do that. I haven't seen any evidence that it's a deterrent, and there are more effective… In my state…
What?
Let's go-- ten bucks. Crisis of confidence. [to Leo] You did one square foot of real estate.
Ten bucks for you. [to Toby] And you-- You big bear, come to me. I'm going to kiss you right on the mouth.
Work hard.
Hey.
No, I decided to go ahead and wear my lucky tie.
Yeah.
Then it's your lucky tie. Why don't you get mine, and we'll go to the plane?
Listen, what do you say I sit in on this meeting for a few minutes. We've got time.
All right.
Okay.
I guess what I don't understand is this. Have I ever exhibited any evidence that I'd be mad if a tie got ruined?
No, I'm not that guy.
The chemicals at the Dry cleaner don't know that.
Josh?
My daughters are here?
Well, I don't approve of that.
I don't approve of that, either. Remember the tie Josh had to give me at the last minute?
There was a lot of juice in that tie. It was like in the last seconds. Just the energy getting me out on stage…
Yeah. I got to go.
Okay.
Why are you telling me this now?
Oh, my God. You're insane. Are you…? You're insane! Charlie!
My wife cut it off with scissors.
I don't think we have that kind of time, Josh.
[on TV] Well, first of all, let's clear up a couple of things. "Unfunded mandate" is two words, not one "big word."
[on TV] There are times when we're fifty states and there are times when we're one country, and have national needs. And the way I know this is that Florida didn't fight Germany in World War II or establish civil rights. You think states should do the governing wall-to-wall. That's a perfectly valid opinion. But your state of Florida got $12.6 billion in federal money last year-- from Nebraskans, and Virginians, and New Yorkers, and Alaskans, with their Eskimo poetry. 12.6 out of a state budget of $50 billion, and I'm supposed to be using this time for a question, so here it is: Can we have it back, please?
Actually, what you've done in Florida is bring the right together with the far right. And I don't think Americans are tired of partisan politics; I think they're tired of hearing career politicians diss partisan politics to get a gig. I've tried it before, they ain't buying it. That's okay, though. That's okay, though, 'cause partisan politics is good. Partisan politics is what the founders had in mind. It guarantees that the minority opinion is heard, and as a lifelong possessor of minority opinions, I appreciate it. But if you're troubled by it, Governor, you should know, in this campaign, you've used the word "liberal" seventy-four times in one day. It was yesterday.
[on TV] No, the question is: Should we focus on 90% of the kids, who go to public school, or give parents money from the public-school budget to send their kids to private school at a time when private schools are even turning kids away who can afford it? Public schools are going to be the best schools in the country. They're gonna be cathedrals. The answer is a change in the way we finance schools!
There it is.
[on TV] That's the ten-word answer my staff's been looking for for two weeks. There it is. Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword. Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high? So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me ten after that, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while… every once in a while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost always include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced moments in leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of the United States, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way, if the left has a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else.
You'll be back.
