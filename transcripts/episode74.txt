Better than if I won my home state but lost my home country. The only poll that matters closes in 17 hours.
Title 63, Chapter 659, Section 43 of New Hampshire election code says electioneering is prohibited within a corridor ten feet wide and extending a distance from the entrance door of the building as determined by the moderator where the election is being held. If anyone knows what that means…
Yeah, I voted for the bond issue. It's going to improve public education without a tax abatement.
Well, one way or another I imagine we'll be talking tonight. I got to get back. You can hockle Abbey for awhile. She's taking the next plane.
Yeah. Listen, you think you could score me a couple of aspirin?
I'm fine.
No, it's just a headache. Just me and you today, okay. I'm fine.
I'll sign these in the car.
Come on.
Okay, this can wait. Let's go.
Hello. Hi. What's going on?
What was wrong with the old way?
What was wrong with the old way?
How?
I hear you've got rules for meetings.
You don't think that's apt to create a resentment among the people who were here before with…? It's not like the thing wasn't working with… Whatever you may assume, that wasn't a rube sitting out there, Debbie. She ran the Oval Office for two years and a state house before that.
What if, instead of you, I want a dial tone?
Why?
You're going to place a lot of my outgoing calls…
I can make my own phone call. Don't be…
I can make my own phone calls.
That's good. That's a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry about that.
Debbie… I have to ask you. Are we talking about…? Did you bring it up 'cause you… noticed…? Is there some particular thing today you noticed?
No, please. I was talking about something else. Line one is you?
Thanks.
I feel like I should be self-deprecating. I mean, it's not inauguration. I could be funny, right? I don't thibk so. I think it's the wrong note. If I'm thanking campaign staff, maybe.
What are you doing?
What?
What?
Halfway aroung the world in Bosnia and Chechnya and Rwanda, they dream of the promise we fulfilled today of a future we chose, for ourelves, together.
Four years ago, we were joined by our highest ideals, by our best hopes, and tonight we're joined by the same commitment to open new doors of oppurtunity and justice.
To ensure that the promise of the country is the birthright of all the people. We've achieved so much together always believing, always knowing that America could be made new again and so it was, and so it will be again. God bless you all. God bless the United States of America.
That was fun.
I feel great.
No, I'm fine.
Yeah.
[beat] How'd you know?
Just for a minute at the end. I couldn't see it.
Yeah, I know. We can still have tonight, though, right?
All right.
