I don't want to intimidate you, but it turns out I'm the first Democrat in twenty years to make a clean sweep of the Plains states and I'm not just talking about Iowa and Nebraska.
Yeah.
I won the Dakotas. The Badlands. The Black Hills. But let's go down, way down, to the Deep South and the humid bayou of Louisiana and its nine electoral votes. What manner of man it must take to win the state, which, by the way, is the only one operating under the Napoleonic Code of France and I still don't know what that's all about, but back to me…
Who's your Commander in Chief?
Yes. And do the ladies like him? Oh, yes. To the tune of 58%.
Yeah?
I thought we had an understanding with regard to tonight and interruptions, Charlie. I thought we were men.
Sam needs to see me?
It's like what, 1:00 in the morning?
Well, let's send him in.
Good to see you.
No, what would make you say that?
No, no, you could have and I'm not going to take any chances, so let's do it now.
I know.
Yeah.
Am I.
Then, I'm behind you 100%.
Man, is everything all right?
Yeah, look, honey, Sam stopped by.
Eyes front, mister.
You sure you're okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you.
As you can see, we've moved on to the caviar course.
I know how you do. Stoli Cristall, the most elegant of vodkas.
The caviar itself is a product of my advice at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. We passed a much more stringent bill against the poaching of Caspian Sea sturgeons.
California white sturgeon from the Stillman Sea Farm in Elverta. Only the best.
Oh, I think you're going to find…
Excuse me.
How you doing?
Okay. Anyone else?
Yeah. You're young, Charlie. Don't you want to be having fun right now?
I get that a lot. Leo.
Yes?
Thank you.
What happened?
The Americans?
Yeah. Well, we kind of knew it was going to be like this.
Jordan still here?
All right, have a good night.
Yeah. Toby!
Hi.
Listen, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Is this anything that could possibly wait until tomorrow?
Well, that's great. Well done. See you tomorrow.
(to Toby) I was this close.
You should marry that girl, Toby.
Wait a second. End of may?
Hang on, I'm doing math in my head. Yeah, end of May? Why didn't you tell us until now?
Yeah, but he's got one.
Really?
It's my Catholicism, Toby. It works for me.
And her. Did you break any laws?
Then a blessing on your house, young man. Mazel tov.
Okay.
Let's go.
