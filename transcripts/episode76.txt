Well, the votes have been counted and the people have spoken, and it's clear that their will is for me to be able to do and have anything I want.
There's a new guy from AP?
Well the President of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence to twenty-five. So, things like that.
That's just greedy. Real power is knowing when to leave a little something on the table.
It's a big country, Arnold. Debbie! Where the hell, first of all, are you and where are my…
Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay, they come from Ipswich!
Have her beheaded for my birthday!
Good morning.
I don't care.
As long as I'm keeping this one.
You bet your ass it is. Which, by the way, I can pat anytime I want now. The voters have spoken. Lowest inflation in twenty years. Housing starts are cyclical, which is the thing. [to Leo] What do you got?
FEMA's on the ground?
All right.
I know my people.
Thank you.
[on TV] Don't get me wrong, Mark. I think January's a good month…
Yeah? It's called penmanship, Watson. Something your generation wouldn't know about because of the computers. How many of these things am I doing?
How many have I done?
Three?
Your system's slowing me down.
You're kidding.
Hey, can't we have color coding and stickers priority list? Can I get a little bureaucracy going here?
I'm doing basically what the President does. Ask people for things, then thank them for things. Let's go. [to Charlie] Take the calls to the mansion. I'll meet you there after this.
We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Ms. Wilburforce or something-- I can't remember-- but…
Really?
Okay, well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats. But they used to bring mice into the house and show 'em to me.
This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.
Good morning.
Tell me about the boy.
11:45?
That's eleven minutes from now.
This meeting's a little premature, isn't it? We should wait ten minutes.
This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay? I don't know why the hell it's here. This isn't a military operation.
My office is a secure room, too, isn't it? Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta go pack some stuff. You see my point?
I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me. I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time.
Coach?
How old is he?
How old is he?
Fifteen. The Shiites, Manny, that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic-surgeon wife? Get this boy in preop. Somebody tell the Swiss to stop standing in the damn doorway with a mouse in their mouth. If they're coming in, come in.
No, 'cause we're all in a secure room except for the Ayatollah's staff, a Swissair pilot, and four hundred other people.
Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilberforce. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Though those are stupid names, and there's something wrong with my kids.
No kidding, you want to crash a space probe into Neptune. That's fine with me. I think we've crashed into most of the planets but $2.5 billion, okay?
If we're going to fail, I want to do it on budget.
You know what? Why don't you tell Debbie we're going to do some calls?
Yes, calls. Calls. Mr. Sarcasm, with your dry… "Calls." I was this close to renaming one of the oceans after you but no way. Maybe… maybe, one of the species of fish, like trout. [to C.J.] "Trout" is now 'charlie.' Went up to the lake, pulled out a couple of nice charlie for dinner.
Look at the size of that charlie you've got mounted on your wall!
What have you got?
Yeah?
Heart and lung.
Knew about it? We did it.
What kind?
What's the room saying?
Can't do it now.
We're not going to not do it. I'm saying just now.
Hi. Before you say anything, here's my idea: the kid needs lungs and a heart. Let's use the Ayatollah's. What are you smiling at?
"The Iranians, they've taken to the streets." Perfect. That goes to the Margaret Museum.
Ah, bite me.
Please.
He didn't want to try, "My son is dying and these guys maybe can fix him? And maybe if our citizens didn't spend quite so much energy denouncing the infidels, they'd have time to build a damn medical school!"
Okay, but just tell me they weren't using cellular technology, 'cause I don't care what anybody says, it doesn't work yet.
What do you mean?
He's going to say no.
No.
No. Come on! That's a fifteen-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital. I want you to pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.
I understand.
Send the communiquE, absolutely. There's a Bahrain Agreement that says… send it. Tell them to stop. Don't even come close… I don't even want a scent of linkage to it. A big damn red cross right on that plane.
Laney says the plane's still six hours out.
What are you talking about?
Where's he?
It's in Pakistan, what does it matter?
Okay, but if I need a life-saving procedure, can you make sure the surgeon's suffering from massive oxygen deprivation?
Aw, don't tell me.
The one guy who can save his son and he tortured his father. That's just bad staff work. Charlie! Are we sure about Japan? I mean, one of these days they're going to find the fairway, right?
Would you pull the First Lady out of whatever she's in right now?
Well, put on a helmet and pads and get in there.
That's it.
Hey, Terry.
Yeah.
No need to thank me. Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?
Really?
What they hell are you talking about?
Wasn't Mrs. Wilberforce our cat?
Really? All right. Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
The Ayatollah's son has it.
No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse.
The only doctor available won't do it.
Persian.
Abbey…
I can't order him to do it.
Through the power vested in me by you?
Just for the record, this is why we don't talk about foreign policy. Which we do, and you don't think we do it enough.
Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for setting that leg.
What 'so'?
The patient right in front of them?
All right. Go back to the sewing thing.
"The boy's on the plane. He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension." That's elevated pressure in the lungs, I think. That could lead to what? Doctor, that could lead to what?
That cold lead to what?
That's what it says here. Follow me.
That's right, and he has something called in situ thrombi.
Dr. Mohebi, I don't care. Why aren't you scrubbing up?
I know.
Doctor…
I know this. Don't you think I know?
I'll let you know who the enemy is. That's my job. It's not a 15-year-old boy.
Doctors Without Borders.
I do know these people. You're crazy if you don't think I do.
Doctor…
Nothing will happen to them.
Nothing will happen to them.
Well, the Swiss, I guess. Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and your family, of course I will. Can I just say that this is how things change for the better? A world-class surgeon or a schoolteacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's divine power. Do me a favor, Doctor, go back to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid, 'cause I think when you do, you're going to scrub up. If you don't, I respect that, and the man made his own bed. Okay?
What was your father's name?
What'd he teach?
Thank you. Get him to Baltimore.
Sure.
You're the nominee.
Is there another Democrat?
You're the nominee.
And I know how you feel. You like Scott Holcomb?
He's terrific.
You're going to campaign on prescription drugs?
Sam.
It's okay to run away from me when you need to.
I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about. You disagreed with me on Medicare. I remember the meeting right here. Then you wrote a five-page memo. Run towards yourself. I'm wrong about that. Walk. You're not going to be used to your surroundings.
You lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll kill you. I'll just kill you, Sam.
Anything else?
Hey.
Yeah. I'm going to bed.
Spill it.
I didn't line up…
I said thanks on the behalf of the ticket. I can't help it if…
They'll thank whatever they want.
I'm freezing it for us. We just won four more years. It's not time for a free-for-all.
Do I call them all back?
All right.
Yeah.
All right. Anything else?
Well, Mohebi's day just started.
Yeah, that's right.
