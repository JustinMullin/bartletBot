What's up?
Uh-huh. I am a character in this story?
I don't see being a character.
Thank you.
Hey.
Could have gone better. I didn't think adultery was against the uniform code.
Yeah. It's against military law?
They told her to stop?
What can she get?
For failure to follow an order?
We shold have that here.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the final Cabinet meeting of Bartlet one. I don't know if this is true, but a Presidential historian told me that this was the most stable cabinet since Hoover's. Which is nice, but you got to think, how many other jobs were really available? But here are facts. You created over nine million new jobs, and the highest home-ownership rate on record. More than 150 new trade agreements. You created the largest expansion of college aid since the GI Bill. Cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps. And you did it all while eliminating 16,000 pages of federal regulations. Not bad for government work. Thank you.
Okay, thank you. [to C.J.] What the hell is going on with the seats in the briefing room?
I'm not worried about it, but I just read about it.
I'll comment on it. I'll say sit your ass where you're told and get back to work.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I'm sorry?
Okay. [to Nancy] We'll have to return.
[to C.J.] Anyway, you're going to take care of it?
Well, I'm sorry to hear you caving, but whatever.
Well, okay, but still, whatever.
Come on in.
Thanks. [to C.J. and Josh] This is Jack Reese. He's working for Nancy. This is Josh Lyman and C.J. Cregg.
They're talking about a force level data-fusion network.
Nancy thinks France will come around after the North Sea exercise.
You agree?
Okay. Thanks very much everybody.
Thank you.
You're going to talk to Berryhill?
He wants to feel loved.
You'll make him feel loved? I want him in the Cabinet.
Thank you.
You think we should get involved?
Abbey and the girls?
Women?
'Cause I got to tell you, I've been hearing it from Abbey and the girls.
What do you think?
No, I meant about Vickie Hilton.
Sure. Yes, but isn't there some question as to whether it's practical to give that order in the first place?
No, I'm just saying there are few side to this.
But we'll hear no others because we don't want it in the Oval Office.
Okay. Anything else?
He's wrong. Leo's wrong. Are we to live with the assumption that there are no men in the services who've commited adultery? I don't know what's worse: being stupid or pretending to be stupid. Tell him that.
No, I'm going to do it.
Eisenhower and Kay Summersby, a subordinate. Hammond with the wives of two junior officers. So, G.I. Jane gets a court-martial? G.I. Joe gets a short film on hygeine? That is all I have to say to you. [points]
I forgot to tell him something else.
That's right. Because men don't give that order to other men.
The daughter of the president of Brazil, which presented a politcal prblem for me. Also, I didn't fire him, I asked him to resign. And I set him up in the private sector. And if you think the differnce is semantics, look up dishonorable discharge in there. Look up Fort Leavenworth.
Yeah.
I read the memo on Rwanda. Average rainfall nine inches. That's the memo Toby wanted me to read?
Why?
[screaming] There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get towed! I hope they get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft show at Shea, a flea market or a tractor show!
Damn it.
Do you really think that Vicky Hilton is unable to distinguish between this order and a combat order?
You're right.
Well, you didn't let me finish.
I may also be right. We get five more people in here, I think we're going to have eight opinions.
So let's.
And two elections in a row, people said they wanted me to run that.
Right now, I'm not talking about overruling anyone or pardoning anyone. Right now, I'm just talking about having people over and asking questions. I like basketball, but I can't play. I don't know why. I played in prep school and I liked being on the team, but I didn't want the ball and the coach said, "Jed, winners always want the ball." I said, "Coach, winners are also better then I am." He said, "Son, to be a winner, you've got to think like a winner." I said, "Coach, to be a winner, you've also got to be better than I am." Anyway, he was right. Winners want the ball. I don't think I ever want to hear it's too sticky for the Oval Office. [at phone, yelling] Except for parking tickets you cheap-ass diplomats! [to Charlie] Read that whole memo on Rwanda, by the way. [to Leo] What are you smiling at?
Are we together on this? Do we have resolve? We've got four years, no election and a Republican Congress that hates me and actually hates you more. You ready to saddle up?
All right. Good then. Happy Thanksgiving.
