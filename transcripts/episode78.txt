There's a new international math and science study. We rank 19 out of 21 countries.
This is what I'm talking about.
South Africa and Cyprus.
No, you don't. Nor us anymore, for that matter. One-third of all math teachers and half of science teachers didn't major or minor in that subject.
And we'll want to get to the bottom of that. But we're increasing education spending to over a $100 billion a year and, as a result, we have seventh grade textbooks being used in ninth grade and the same answers get a higher score on S.A.T.s.
Right. But I'm talking about children now.
On the S.A.T.s?
You don't want to know.
I got 800/790. For the life of me, I can't imagine what I got wrong. Then I took them again, and got 800/790. I mean, is it possible there was some sort of number-two pencil anomaly that could've…?
Yeah, I know, it's a little… something.
So our schools have reached a crisis and our infant mortality rate is two and a half times what it is in Singapore. So what I think we should do for starters is, we should keep more people alive, then send them to school. Get a little peace and prosperity going.
Stanley, the width and depth of what I haven't done about it yet… You know you can't do anything about hurricanes? The President can't do anything about nature or bad luck. I ought to be able to do something about the airplane.
Wait, what'd I just say?
What do airplanes signify?
Really.
Stanley, I never thought to ask, but you are a doctor, right?
Yeah.
I've been spacing out for a minute at meetings. Three times this week. I hear someone talking and realize I wasn't listening to part of it.
Very.
Hi. Yeah. [hangs up phone] It's Leo.
What's going on?
Why?
And now we're one-third of the way through an Agatha Chrstie story. [gravely] "Where nobody be goin' nowhere. The bridge is washed out." Well, I'm finished. But I was doing the guy that says that in the Agatha Christie stories. Stanley, as always. Leo, I'll be in the office.
Yeah?
It's not that cold.
Charlie.
I want to see Josh in his office. Let him know I'm coming.
Listen, this is going to sound crazy but Olympia Buckland had an infant mortality bill that we asked her not to take out of committee 'cause it was too expensive.
I'd like her initiative or something similiar to be folded into the HHS budget.
No, I mean I want it for the next Congress. You understand what I'm saying?
A little bit, yeah. If we nip and tuck in different departments we can do it. It'll take an around-the-clock kind of effort. Yes it's a holiday, but OMB works for us, right?
You think this is crazy?
?
Thank you.
Toby here yet?
So, finally we meet.
Want to come in?
Okay. Well, I sent some notes on the Congressional section.
Isn't that why you're here?
To see me.
I thought it was about the notes on the Congressional section.
Okay. Would you like to come back with Toby?
Well, thanks for stopping by.
He's the best-looking person I've ever seen in real life.
Oh, would you?
Yeah, that was a setback for the Bourbons. Listen…
Zoey, I think it's really sweet that you still come to me for permission. You're classy, and you're old-fashioned.
Not in a million years.
Listen. Sit down for a second.
When you were little, like two, I really wanted you to like me and I wan't sure you did. With Liz and Ellie, my act just worked and with you I had to try harder.
I did something a few months ago and I'm sure I was right and I'd do it again but it's hard to live with. This is ridiculous. You're freezing. Come inside.
Come inside.
You know, why don't you go back to the Residence and make sure your mom hasn't killed your boyfriend. Yeah, he can come to Manchester. He's going to have more Secret Service stuff to do, and he's going to have to sleep in the root cellar which, like your bedroom door, will be guarded round the clock by two U.S. Marshals.
I almost told her. I've been feeling it a little lately. I've been exorcising my guilt by having Josh crowbar infant mortality money into the HHS budget on December 23 at 8:00.
How's it going?
Yeah.
Yeah. We'll figure it out.
Stanley thought it was weird that I took the SAT's again, too.
You don't think it's possible that the remaining answer was important?
Really?
How the hell would you know? You got 1400.
Yeah, send them in.
Yeah. Listen, my reasons for not wanting to talk about campaign reform at the Inauguration are simple. It's not a legislative speech and when we cite issues, it should be the ones that affect people's lives. You agree?
Anything else?
Not very well so far.
Okay, except when I asked you to come into the Oval Office you said, "No, no, no. No, no, no, no."
And you called me Mr. Justice.
