It's the curse of every daughter's father.
I don't like them. I don't like them at all.
What the hell happened with you two? It was perfect. I just kept you in the office all the time.
That was the point. If I was trying to make her happy, I'd buy her a Cabriolet.
C-Jean. Stable economies with free-flowing uranium don't make for a stable world community. Did I make that point?
Good. And is there a cow on my schedule today?
[to Charlie] I'm meeting with a cow. I shouldn't worry about it.
I like your sass.
What, are you touring?
[to Charlie] Am I right on time?
How you doing? Good to see you. Great. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. How are you? How are you?
[still shaking hands]  How are you today?
We live in an interdependent world and we should act like it. We live in a global community and we should sustain it. We should cross borders. We should cross borders to build sustainable democracies that can banish privation and fear. And we should cross borders to bring food and medicine and roads and schools and teachers to parts of the world forgotten by all but the warlords. We're gonna pass this Foreign Ops bill. This should be a century of hope and prosperity everywhere. And America is going to lead the world and not just bully it. Thank you.
[to Leo] What the hell is going on?
[to Zoey] Hey, thanks, Peach Patch. [to Leo] What the hell is going on?
Which is why we can't get her on the phone?
We have many, many backup plans in the works? Josh has broken people into teams and they're developing and executing rapid-response backup plans?
Oh, my God.
Please, my daughter's dating a kid who's better-looking than my wife. I have only so much RAM to give over to-- C.J.!
I'm sorry, but once again, there's a cow?
Yeah, I got that part. It was…
And that's great. But a picture of me and a cow…
Why did you agree to it in the first place?
Abbey set it up?
Well, good luck with that. Now turn around casually and tell me if Le Vicomte de Valvert has got his hands anywhere near anyone who's related to me.
[yelling] Zoey!
Yeah, I think you'd respond if I stopped feeding you!
There are a couple of thousand miltary families on food stamps. I can't stand it; the Pentagon knows it. Some families are eligible, some aren't. To change it, they'd have to raise everyone's pay, which they can't do, and this memo's a reminder. It's a get-off-our-backs memo. And you thought you were done with turf wars.
You decommissioned two aircraft carriers.
No.
Boy, Zoey's growing up nicely, isn't she?
I'm on your side in this thing, but just barely. Just by a little bit, because he's French and royal. These are very special, very limited circumstances under which we're allies, you and I.
You still got it?
The letter from the rope line.
Put it in my bag tonight.
Mr. McGarry, Mr. Ziegler, Mr. Lyman, Ms. Cregg. It's the Tepmtations. I love you guys.
Hit me.
Million?
For an RV? What's he want?
I like it. There should a button on my desk I can press and 49 people instantly pray for me.
How'd it work out?
Well, that's the problem.
Yes.
Okay, well, good news. Keep us posted on that.
Is there something I should be doing I'm not doing?
Oh, wait. You guys didn't come in here to tell me something funny?
[pointing at Josh] You… you, are the wildcard, my friend, because you…
…because you will throw out the baby, the bathwater, and the bubbles at curtain time if it means…
Feel free to interrupt.
I don't care if they care! I care! And oh, by the way, so do you!
Toby?
Well, in my faith, we've known it's worked for two thousand years. I never knew there was data available, but okay.
No.
Maxine.
Oh, I don't care. But what I was going to say…
You're not willing to toss it overboard to win. You're willing to toss it overboard to avoid disappointing Leo. You know what the difference is between you and me? I want to be the guy. You want to be the guy the guy counts on.
We know.
And work down?
If we can get it.
When I lose, I don't look for consolation in the score and I know for sure you don't. So, it's what we should do, right?
All right, tough beat. It's an unbelievably tough beat.
Hey, Zoey's growing up very nicely, isn't she?
Anything else?
Tough beat, everybody. Thanks for the work. Next time, we let Josh do it the way he wants.
Bill Haley?
Okay.
When's this thing with the cow?
Okay.
You think?
I don't know. I don't know everybody. C.J. wants to cancel the goat picture. Half the world's people live on less than two dollars a day. 130 million will never step inside a schoolhouse. Ingredients for bombs can be purchased at hardware stores and we've just given the Third World what the doctor ordered: rollbacks. Heifer International… they give free cows and goats to people who need milk?
Well, then, I don't think that we're in any position to be snotty. Let's do it… Let's do it right now.
I'm not standing in this picture alone. This was a total team failure. Stand where you want, but I want my Chief of Staff and my Chief Political Advisor standing near the goat.
Let's go. [to Josh] Set that clock for 90 days.
