Yellowstone, established by an act signed by Ulysses S. Grant was the nation's first national park - March 1, 1872.
[smiling] Well, we're through with work, Josh, but this part's fun.
The part where I get you to sit down, and teach you a little something.
Yeah.
No.
I'm a national park buff, Josh.
[smiling] I said I'm a national park buff. I bet you didn't know that about me.
Why is that?
Really?
I assume that was said with all due respect.
[gets up and sits near Josh] Is it nerd-like to know that Everglades National Park is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the continental United States, AND has extensive mangrove forests?
There are 54 national parks in the country, Josh.
I HAVE been to all of them. I should show you my slide collection.
[counting with fingers] Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Badlands, Capitol Reef, Acadia, which is so often overlooked…
Dry Tortugas…
Petrified Forests, North Cascades, Joshua Tree, Shenandoah National Park, right here in Virginia! [bangs hand on couch] We should organize a staff field trip to Shenandoah. What do you think? [walks to his desk and writes a note]
What was that?
See, and I was gonna let you go home.
We're gonna talk about Yosemite.
We beat the Banking Lobby!
We beat them.
Yep. It's in the bag.
Ooh, C.J., Everglades National Park is one of the biggest…
Right. I got to take this call so I can gloat about the Banking Bill.
Be talking about this C.J. This is the story!
[starts to leave] Crunch them!
[stops] Oh, incidentally, the California Live Oak is the…
Right.
Twelfth round knockout, C.J.! []
This is the saddest looking cabinet I have ever… look at this. I have an agriculture secretary who hasn't eaten a vegetable in his life. Everybody sit down. You're freaking me out. Good morning, Leo.
Hello. Are you taking minutes?
What's your name?
Mildred? I'm Josiah Bartlet. I'm the President of the United States.
What did I miss?
Uh, would you skip down, please?
Actually, I find these meeting to be a fairly mind-numbing experience, but Leo assures me that they are Constitutionally required, so let's get it over with. Proceed, Mildred.
Who said that?
Our first goal should be finding a way to work with Congress?
You don't think our first goal is should be finding a way to best serve the American People?
Really? Let's have a look. [takes out his glasses and reads Mildred's notes] Yeah, that's what it says right here. Would you like Mildred to read it back again?
Okay. Anything else?
Good. Now let's get to work.
In Montana?
What happened?
Eaton and Broderick?
Eaton and Broderick attached a land-use rider?
I'm surprised Eaton and Broderick had taken an interest in anything.
For what?
What did I do to them during the campaign?
They want to strip-mine Big Sky?
Yeah.
Excuse me, fellas, over here please.
What do you do, Josh?
Toby.
Leo.
I don't like these people, Toby. I don't want to lose.
All right. What's next?
Hey.
No, don't get up.
No, it's fine. Please.
Nah, I just came to see what you were doing.
Nah, you know, we had most of the night blocked for that thing, and it got cancelled so…
Nah.
[sits] Nah. I still got 400 pages of nonsense to read.
I don't like rattling around in that place with no one around but the butlers.
Maybe later.
You had breakfast with Mal?
How's she doing?
What did you expect?
You ignored her mother.
No, I'm saying that's what it looks like to her right now.
She doesn't see what the job is, Leo. And anyone would have to see it to believe it. And even if they saw it, even if they believed it, what would it matter? She's her mother's daughter, and you made her mother cry.
Well, I'm right next door all night.
Okay.
Well, this is fine.
They had you write this?
You're not a little overqualified for a birthday message?
Really?
I appreciate it, Sam.
[walks Sam to the door] Listen…
I mean as long as you're on it, and you don't mind, why don't we take advantage of your being on it and, you know, really do a job?
It's his fiftieth birthday. Let's give it the Sam Seaborn quill. What do you think?
Good. Take your time. Bring me back the next draft when it's ready. I really appreciate it, Sam.
Hey, C.J.
No, sit down.
When are Josh and Toby gonna come up with a solution, huh?
I want the banking bill, and I don't want to give in.
Yeah.
I don't want to hear about Hoynes and the cabinet meeting.
Is Danny gonna make it a thing?
What did you have to give him?
[pause] Sold.
Sure he was.
You're wrong.
Mildred?
Let's drop it.
Anything else?
Okay. Get out of here.
Hey, Mal.
Margaret! [looks at Mallory] Hey, you're all dressed up.
Yes, uh, could you bring me the chief of staff's schedule for today, please?
Thank you. [looks at Mallory] You look a little glum, Mallory. Did you have plans to go out this evening with someone who had to cancel due to circumstances beyond their control because they have made a commitment to a common and higher purpose?
Oh, thank you Margaret. [to Mallory] These are some of the things your father did today. [reading] He met with the director of the C.I.A., and received an intelligence briefing regarding stores of plutonium in a country which, shall we just say is not on our Christmas card list. He brokered a compromise among democrats for funding of something fairly trivial, but I can't remember quite what it was, oh yes, the U.S. Army, yes. He met with chief counsel to discuss the news hat it's possible I've broken some federal laws in the week and may have to serve from one to three years in prison after resigning my office in disgrace. [to Leo] How'd that go by the way?
Cool. He received a security briefing, a Central American briefing, and wrote a position paper, and he's been counseling me throughout the day of a bad decision I have to make. Oh, and by the way, this was a very light day.
Uh… that's a perfectly fair question.
Okay.
I'm right next-door.
[heads for his office, but stops] Oh, my point is… give your dad a break. He's your father.
Are you blowing me off?
Okay.
Yes?
[beat] Yeah, okay.
How are you, John?
Good. What can I do for you?
C.J. already talked to Danny Concannon. I think we're fine.
Well, that's a different story.
Okay.
Good night, John.
John?
John…
Really?
You shouldn't have made me beg, John. I was asking you to be Vice President.
Then don't stand there and ask the question, John. It weakened me right out of the gate. You shouldn't have made me beg.
Yeah.
Good night, John. [looks at Hoynes as he leaves]
Both black and grizzly bears inhabit Glacier Park, Charlie. And hikers are told to talk or sing along the trail to keep them at bay.
It's not as silly as it sounds.
I suppose.
Yes, Glacier Park was the tenth. We have 44 to go.
Have a good night, Charlie.
[to Josh] What have you got?
I can do this?
You understand it's a bunch of rocks, right?
[stands] More than a right, Josh.
It's a treat.
You would enjoy nature.
The antiquities act!
This is simplicity itself.
Good job.
Thank you.
Good night.
[to agent] Thank you. Good night.
[looks back] Yeah?
What?
Yeah.
Good night.
