Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?
Well, that's only going to be clear if we also hand out decoder rings. Listen, it's an Inauguration Ball. Let's enjoy ourselves.
Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
You read it?
You haven't weighed in.
No.
Thank you, Claudia.
Josh.
How much?
Yeah.
Well, their curiosity will be slacked in about 41 minutes. Listen.
I have a problem.
All right, two problems.
I don't have a bible.
I kept changing my mind all week on which bible I wanted to use, and then I finally settled on the George Washington Bible but we ran into a problem with the New York Freemasons, which we don't have time to get into.
Yeah. Charlie's out hunting one down, but he's not back yet.
Is that true?
You think that's a good idea?
You sure?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hi.
Yeah, I may need to get a room.
No kidding. In the last two minutes, three people have reminded me what Jefferson said in his Inaugural.
The problem is that when he said it, your best chance of getting entangled with an ally was by rowboat.
Charlie's here.
Thank you.
Donnie's Motel?
They didn't have one in the House Library?
Okay.
Mr. Chief Justice.
What do I do then?
And will there be someone who'll tell me when it's time to do that?
I do. May I continue?
[to prompter operator] Can we pull foreign policy up on the prompter?
[to Toby] What's going on?
So what?
A meter?
What are you talking about?
"Fear of cancer from asbestos, fuzzy science manifestos."
Which one's Will?
"America cannot be the world's policeman. America cannot enforce its own values, its own standards across the world. Yet when it's in our clear an vital interests…" We're being candid at least.
No kidding. Look, I understand I present a uniform gap, but I want to mean what I say.
The Chief Justice wrote a poem.
What do you mean?
Powdered wigs?
You think he stayed to long at the fair?
Neither am I.
This foreign policy language is ridiculous.
What's going on in Khundu?
I got a short security cable this morning about civil unrest in the Republic of Equatorial Khundu, and I had to reach for an atlas.
I know that now.
Two warring tribes?
They're being evacuated?
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah?
From where?
They do?
And they need several days notice?
Why?
Are they not sure where it is?
I'm going to be using the Bartlet Bible. That's at the New Hampshire Historical Society.
Yes.
Hoping beyond hope.
I can't remember your name, but are you asking me out on a date?
Okay.
No, he was talking to me, your Eminence. [to Zake] Your Excellency, I got a very sketchy intelligence report on the violence in the capitol about an hour ago.
I didn't know that.
Yes.
No.
Yeah?
And?
I can't?
Just as the disciples intended.
The Jefferson bible doesn't warp?
Probably. Speaking of New Hampshire, don't I own the Bartlet Bible?
I know. I bought it.
And they won't loan it back to me so that I can be inaugurated?
Yeah. His name is really Mr. Cravenly? You're not making that up?
Okay, would you tell him that I'd like very much to use my family's Bible, which my family has bought at least twice now.
You know, a couple hundred people got killed today in Khundu.
The Arkutu control the government and they're killing…
I'm sorry?
Yeah, mm-hmm.
No.
Yeah. Ask Bob Slattery to come over here.
Yeah.
Bobby, what's going on?
The Catholic Church has better intelligence than we do?
None?
How many are dead right now?
Estimate.
Bobby, I don't want to make noise but I want to see a forced depletion report. I want to know how many we'd lose and I want to do it without going three rounds in the newspaper with Miles Hutchison. Who do we have at the Pentagon who could do this for us?
You trust him?
Tell him I want to see forced depletion on a peacekeeping force in Khundu. And tell him we'll do our best to keep it away from the Secretary's office.
Thank you.
Hey, I changed my mind about the Bible.
I don't know. I never… it just seems parochial. I hate saying that.
There's a Bible in North Hampton, Masachusetts, that Johnathon Edwards used. Let's get that.
"Grace is but glory begun and glory is but grace perfected." I made my Bible selection.
It's awkwardly worded.
Oh, God.
A what?
How do you know?
And I'm worried about the White House making that suggestion.
Wasn't that a rumor?
All right, listen. I've asked for a forced depletion report on action in Khundu.
Slatterly got Jack Reese.
The best scenario is that simply by engaging, the Arkutu lay down their weapons, but that doesn't seem likey, so we'd lose people.
More if they go into the countryside.
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
Good.
You should.
Hey, is this it?
Good to meet you.
Of course.
This?
It's huge.
Actually, it can't be.
The First Lady has to hold this in her hand. This one's going to take the First Lady, the Chief Justice and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
Okay… Mr. Carlton?
Sorry. Thanks. Charlie's going to take care of you. [to Charlie] Charlie, that Bible's the size of a Volkswagon. Can we get the Washington Bible?
Thank you.
Toby been taking his pants off again? That's just something he does.
How's it going?
Good.
Yeah. What's hard is that foreign policy has become a statement of what we won't do.
"A new doctrine for a new century, based not just on our interests, but on our values across the world." Well, that's pretty spicey stuff.
Yeah, I know. Why is a Khundunese life worth less to me than an American life?
That was ballsy.
You Tom Bailey's son?
Talk about the very model of a modern Major General.
We'll send condolences. What's next?
Okay.
Well, if he's old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis, I guess he's old enough to be king of Bhutan. What's next?
Coast Guards got it?
What's happening? I'm sorry, what's happening in the REK?
Well, a proclamation ought to do the trick. What's the CIA know that I should know?
All right, thank you.
Yeah. Hey, I changed my mind. Not the Washington Bible.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm going to use my father's.
Did you talk to Hutchinson?
[to Charlie] Tell Josh I'll just be a minute, okay?
Did he tell me to shut up and let him run the Pentagon?
How many?
So Hutchinson know I've seen forced depletion.
He should be pissed at me, not Jack Reese.
Don't worry about it. Right?
Don't worry about it.
Clark says neighbors are swapping family members in Khundu.
Also, there's a new king of Bhutan. And he's been bar mitzvaed and everything.
Hey, this guy you hired for the Inauguration speech gave me a little back chat a few minutes ago.
Yeah, he was using a floor speech about El Salvador I gave 98 years ago to demonstrate that the U.S. should send troops to Khundu. Rhetorically, I said, "Why is a Khundunese life worth less to me than an American life?" And he said, "I dont know, sir, but it is."
Thank you.
Hey, Josh. There's intelligence that Khundunese neighbors in the country are swapping family members.
For the night, they're swapping family members you know, and sleeping in each other's houses.
What's going on?
State?
Tell them…
It's not.
The language is being polished.
Some of which have my name on them. So tell Jeff Tomlison and baby Bob to take a deep knee bend, would you? I'm just as big a cotton candy ass as they are.
You're just going to let that hang in the air?
Damn right.
No.
