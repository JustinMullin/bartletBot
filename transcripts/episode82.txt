Charlie, I'm going to change my mind again on te Bible.
Aren't you afraid that one day I'm just going to kick your ass like it's never been kicked?
Let's go with the Washington Bible.
Just put it on a plane.
What do the Freemasons have to do with it?
Take a train.
Buy three tickets.
Are you trying to tell me that Freemasons don't like me?
Thank you.
I saw C.J. smiling before. Has something good happened?
What?
I didn't?
It's not different.
Well, then it was a dodged bullet.
Leo, come on…
You're being paranoid.
You think in your wildest dreams that Hutchinson's running an offense? He's that pissed that I asked for forced Depletion Report he's going to show me in Danny's byline I go to Khundu and here's what happened in Bermuda?
[sighs] Abbey's already gone to bed. I should get up there.
No. [starts to walk off]
[yells back] Good night.
Abbey.
Abigail.
Abbey, the kids are eating sugar.
How you doing? You know I gave the kids candy all the time, right?
Yes.
Well, it was for sale, and I wanted it.
I'm going to stay up for a bit and read and watch some news.
His grandkids were in here?
I don't.
For the record…
Frederick the Great told his generals… to defend everything is to defend nothing.
I don't really know what that means, do you?
Well, that makes two of us.
I'll be in soon.
I was their dealer. Live with it.
Leo McGarry, please.
We're for freedom of speech everywhere. We're for freedom to worship everywhere. We're for freedom to learn… for everybody. And because, in our time, you can build a bomb in your country and bring it to my country, what goes on in you country is very much my business. And so we are for freedom from tyranny everywhere, whether in the guise of political oppresion, Toby, or economic slavery, Josh, or religious fanaticism, C.J. That most fundamental idea cannot be met with merely our support. It has to be met with our strength. Diplomatically, economically, materially. And if pharoah still don't free the slaves, then he gets the plagues, or my cavalry, whichever gets there first. The USTR will go crazy and say that we're not considering global trade. Committee members will go crazy and say I haven't consulted enough. And the Arab world will just go indescriminately crazy. No country has ever had a doctrine of intervention when only humanitarian interests were at stake. That streaks going to end Sunday at noon. So, if you're on board with this, what I need you to do…
[to Leo] Do I just keep standing here?
"Set free the oppressed, break every yoke, clothe the naked and your light shall break forth like the dawn, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard."
That was Isaiah.
Who?
Well, then here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women.
I think you're wrong. But if you're right, then okay. We should all have a little skin in this.
So we're doing well so far.
Sunday noon.
Not because, no. Not because of Laurel and Hardy. That was simply the confluence of the final, you know, and… also, by the way, from the mouths of babe-- like yourself. Seriously, from the mouths of babes and clowns come-- Listen, there's no reason why anyone needs to know about Laurel and Hardy.
Too cold for a parade. Bunch of tanned-ass Southerners.
Which is to the south of New Hampshire. Don't tell me geographic stereotypes.
I walked to school every morning in weather colder than this.
That's right, baby. Just a camel hair coat, leather gloves, a varsity scarf and these wits.
It's here?
What is the problem? It was in New York. It could have gotten here on a fast horse.
And?
Because?
And it didn't come in last night…
Three for the freemasons and one for the Bible.
Three hotel rooms and four train tickets.
Okay. You know what? Washington didn't bring his own Bible, he just assumed one would be provided, which, frankly, isn't unreasonable. Guy wants you to swear an oath on a Bible, he ought to be packing a Bible. Washington had someone get one from across the street.
Just common courtesy I think. "Place your hand on this Bible." And, "Oh, can I use your Bible?" That's not right.
Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?
Good evening.
Everything all right?
They're saying I'm rewriting the Constitution on the back of a napkin. They're saying on FOX that a guy who couldn't run a local sheriff's department wants to send troops around the world. They're saying it's liberalism with a grenade launcher. But they're not saying it was badly written, so that's something. And they sure as hell know I was serious, so that's something else. Congratulations, folks. We've got ourselves a doctrine.
Will, I think some of these people don't know who your dad is. Will's the youngest son of Tom Bailey, who's the only guy in the world with a better title than mine. He was Supreme Commander, NATO Allied Forces Europe. We didn't know we were going to do this. I would have asked you to invite him.
Actually, I meant he could be here now when I tell you Toby's asked me to commission you as his deputy.
Toby wants to make you deputy.
I'm appointing you Deputy Communications Director. It covers a wide range of areas of policy and execution and counsel to me.
Yes.
[to Will] Excuse me?
Hi. [motions Will to come closer] Sam's going to be promoted to Senior Counselor if he loses the 47th.
[to the gang] That's what you want to hear from your new Communications--
There's a promise that I ask everyone who works here to make. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful and commited citizens can change the world. You know why?
William Bailey, reposing special trust and confidence in your integrety, prudence and ability, I designate you to the post of Deputy White House Director of Communications and Special Assistant to the President. And I do authorize you to execute and fulfill the duties of that office with all the powers and privileges and subject to the conditions prescribed. It is affirmed by my signature…
…and affixed with the Seal of of the Unites States.
And it is done so on this day and in this place.
Congratulations.
[holding a piece of paper in his hand] You know, it's easy to watch the news and think of Khundunese as either hapless victims or crazed butchers, and it turns out that's not true. I got this intelligence summary this afternoon. "Mothers are standing in front of tanks." And we're going to go get their backs. An hour ago, I ordered Fitzwallace to have UCOMM deploy a brigade of the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Air Assualt, and a Marine Expeditionary Unit to Khundu to stop the violence. The 101st are the Screaming Eagles. The Marines are with the 22nd M.E.U., trained at Camp Lejuene, some of them very recently. I'm sorry, everyone, but this is a work night.
