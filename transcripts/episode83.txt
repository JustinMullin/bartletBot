I don't understand, did we just get put on call waiting or something?
Wendall's answering the phones at U.S. European Commamnd?
Is he placing a bet?
Thank you.
Me?
I get it.
And I agree with you.
I can tell by the way you laughed in my face at the suggestion that I was.
I heard that. Why?
I've told him over and over about money and endorsements from outside the district. Why is he going to Brentwood?
What does Joey say?
The right to privacy's a value, so is clean air.
OMB?
Deficit-nuetral, we've had 14 meetings.
What's wrong with booze and a comfortable pickup? Scoring.
Is there going to be a democrat tax plan, or am I going to be stuck in NEC scoring hell for the rest of my term?
What do salmon runs have to do with it?
Last week it was a banana embargo. Is Congress opening a restaurant?
Aren't there quite a few reasons?
Miss Humentashen.
Leo said just now that there was going to be an NEC briefing on scoring and tell her what I said.
No there's not.
Mr. Ambassador, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I was just in the White House Situation Room.
I've just taken your airport… [shakes his hand] …clearing the way for the 101st Air Assualt to take the capitol. 7,000 troops, 25 battle tanks, 15 Apache attack helicopters, and three destroyers. Strictly speaking, I conquered your country without the paperwork.
No, it's not. It's in the midst of a one-sided slaughtering of an entire people. Both the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Vatican have pleaded with President Nzele for a cease-fire and both the U.N. and the Holy Father have struck out to the peril of 115,000 Induye men, women, and God knows children, particularly the boys.
The heads of Ghana, Nigeria and Zaire have similairly sent packing. The Red Cross has been denied entry on three seperate occasions in the last ten says. President Nzele has 36 hours to give the command to his troops to hand over their weapons to the 82nd Divison Airborne Division of the United States Army. At 36 hours and one minute, I give the order for the 101st Air Assualt to take Bitanga and run up our flag. I skipped breakfast. Anybody want coffee or something?
Right. On the other hand, 20% of your youth is unemployed. They're just living to live.
Yeah, it helps when someone else is picking up the bigger ticket items like a national defense.
I'm sorry?
Excellent.
Yes, absolutely, send them in.
Yeah, whatever, hang on a second. [to Josh] What do you need?
No, that's all right. What do you need?
Come here.
If you leave, I'll kill you.
I'm sorry, Jean-Paul, I'll have to cut it short. Josh has gotten himself in a jam. But I'll see you on the plane tonight, and I'll look forward to continue the discussion on, you know, what's wrong with me.
What?
You think the Republicans are rolling out their tax plan?
Thank God.
'Cause we can roll out ours and I don't have to sit through another seven scoring meetings.
Why not respond Saturday or Sunday? Better yet, let's go first. Call the press in, and I'll do it right now.
Toby?
It'll be ready tomorrow?
I say we respond to theirs with ours, but we do it tomorrow or Sunday.
Then that's where we do it.
And announce from the White House.
That's a killer decision. But let's lean towards Sam and say we keep our mouths shut in California and then come out fighting Monday morning.
No response from the White House?
[blows raspberry] There's my response.
[to Ed] Sing it, Larry.
15% cut across the board? Cutting capital gains 50%!
And it's actually going to cost?
I'm not an economist, but no… Wait, I am an economist. So, their plan will do what, C.J.?
Explode the deficit. Will it stimulate the economy, Josh?
Josh gets extra credit for being funny and right at the same time, and how long do I have to stay quiet, Toby?
And not kill Sam?
And so I shall.
Man, I'm sorry about this. [hugs Sam]
The French have denied us access to their airspace. I'm not sure why they think we're going to need it to get from here to Africa, but what the hell. This weekend's all about you. Get up there.
This is going to be about France. Did we accidently trap people in a theme park?
[into phone] Yeah?
Mrs. Hottentot?
Yeah, where are they?
What do you mean?
They're under arrest?
Did they rob the bar?
Uh-huh. And what did Charlie do?
Toby and Charlie were arrested in a bar fight.
Really?
Everytime we come to Southern California we are absolutely the Clampetts.
I came…
You really don't want to shake up a campaign like this at this point in the election calendar.
Guys, we've got to keep our voices down a little.
Scott…
Why are you putting Sam next to business?
No, I'm just curious.
Josh…
Tell Toby to take over the campaign.
Yeah. [into phone] Leo, I just fired Scott Holcomb. Toby, who, with Charlie, is meeting with a bails bondsman right now, has to come off the payroll for a week.
What?
What do you mean they've been taken?
We secured the airport.
What are we doing?
We're coming home.
Tell Ghana to tell Nzele he's got 9 hours and 20 minutes before I take him.
Thanks.
Lieutenant.
How old are you?
Let's go.
