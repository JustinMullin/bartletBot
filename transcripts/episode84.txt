How come it's never people with six months to live who are taken hostage? I mean there's so much of it, you'd think once in a while we'd catch a break.
Yeah.
Would you all excuse me?
[into phone] Yeah?
What happens if, screw the deadline, we just go to full deployment right now?
All right, we got to go get them.
All right, then, on my order.
They're here?
Who are they?
Is the three-year-old in there?
This is my first time doing this particular one.
Good morning, I'm Jed Bartlet. Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez?
Mrs. Rowe?
Mrs. Halley, is it all right if I call you Diane?
Are you Betty?
Are you three years old?
Are you scared now?
Don't be. Diane, do you mind if Betty sat in the next room with my secretary, Ms. Fiderer?
[to guards] Thank you. [to families] Please. Mm-hmm.
Yeah. It was taken off of Kundunese TV.
Yeah, sure.
I'm afraid so, sir, yes. We're currently negotiating for Red Cross access so they can get medical attention.
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that either.
Mr. Hernandez, I can only imagineâ€¦
No, ma'am, I can't.
Excuse me, please.
Let's go.
Why a wet team?
Why the CIA wet team? We're not near water.
I had to ask. What's it called?
Go.
At what point do we start to worry?
Hack was 2 hours and 47 minutes.
Yeah, but it's four hours and ten minutes now. I've got three parents, a wife and a three-year-old up there. At what point do I tell them what's going on?
[to Fitzwallace] Ask him to confirm it again.
What's that?
What does that mean?
What's Red Haven?
Fitz, what's going on?
It was a suicide bombing.
[to Fitzwallace] I want Threat Con Charlie for Africa and Europe.
[to Leo] Why don't you go talk to the families?
