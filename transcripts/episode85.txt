Hello.
Oh, okay. I didn't ask for five?
She's allowed to do that?
Ah, it's okay. Thanks.
Yeah, what the hell's going on?
I know and when she called me at five, I was going to say call me back in an hour and go back to sleep. I was going to do it myself.
Yeah, and now I missed the whole thing.
Operation Resting Eagle.
You know I was having a little fun in my sleep. It's how I relax. Wait, let me put my glasses on. Something's turning me on about you, and I can't tell why.
Oh, yeah!
I got in late last night.
We didn't even leave Nashville until after ten. I ended up touring a weapons research facility in Oak Ridge. They've got one of the most powerful reactors in the world. They were able to show me an insulin molecule. Basically scoop up two zinc ions.
You're a scientist and your still making fun of this?
Anyway, look, I'm trying to tell you something.
You know what? That's okay, I'm going to get that.
No, I'll get them, thanks.
Lay out the papers, yes, and today I'd like you to alphabetize them.
Anyway when we finally got back from Nashville, Leo was waiting.
I don't know but we're going to be interested in that less right now than we are in other things.
Foreign Ops came out of mark-up.
It's good. They only cut two billion and shifted half a billion from the Sub Saharan to Western Europe because I guess the crippling hunger in Provence has given the lactose intolerant a problem with-- I don't know but I can live with all that.
Clancy Bangart attached an amendment.
Stipulating that Foreign Ops dollars wouldn't go to any overseas clinics that council abortion.
Yeah.
This is the Senate. They can do that.
No, there was no indication. Clancy Bangart doesn't let me know what he's thinking.
There's a handful, a handful and a half of cranky conservative Senators who want this stuff, and were waiting to pounce. It's what happened.
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
I don't know yet.
I don't know.
I'm not prepared to do that yet.
I don't know.
I'm not prepared to do that yet.
I know what the gag rule is.
That's great except people are starving to death, and they're dying of disease to death, and they can't cook the Bill of Rights.
I really don't know Abbey, the day hasn't started yet.
Will's a good boy.
Yeah.
Marblehead?
No, some of us call her Marblehead.
Cause you're a pirate?
I know what they were.
Today?
Yeah, you did.
We don't have to ask you to screw up Abbey, you do by yourâ€¦
I can't publicly reprimand you, it wouldn't play well. We save you for other things.
You want to hear about Max Weber?
German thinker Max Weber said that politics is the "slow boring of hard boards and that anyone who seeks to do it must risk his own soul". You know what that means?
It means that change comes in excruciating increments for those who want it. You're trying to move mountains. It takes lifetimes. But Zoey Bartlet is the newest Daughter of the American Revolution so I like our chances for the long run.
Yes.
Till the bulk of the bill is appropriated.
Yeah.
You don't.
We will.
Keep talking, I'm going to turn off the light.
No, I have to get up early.
