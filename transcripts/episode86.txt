[to Ed and Larry] He's telling me the deadline for Columbia's recertification is midnight tonight.
[to Leo] Didn't I sign those papers all ready?
Just to check, they're going to tell me that the narco-trafficantes are running the Parliament, but that we should recertify them as an ally in the drug war.
You mean calling them an enemy.
And the deadline for that is today, right?
Jessie, left turn, maintain altitude?
Leo, hang on a second. [to Weiskopf] What's the problem on the ground?
Then what happens?
And then what happens?
Yeah.
You'll keep me briefed?
Thank you.
Well, it should cost more, don't you think?
You got a lot more of these stories?
I've got a plane full of reporters up here.
[to Leo] We'll we're going to give it a try. [hangs up phone]
Charlie, stay in here, would you? Here's what's going on. The light that indicates that the landing gear is locked didn't go on, which usually indicates that there's something wrong with the light. But what they're going to do is, they've sent a fighter jet to fly up alongside and get visual confirmation that it's down, and then we land. Here's the tricky part.
The press can't know this is going on. There are two issues. One is that the Nikkei's about to open, the other is national security. We can't broadcast that Air Force One is up in the air over West Virginia and can't land.
Okay.
Yeah, it's confirmed. Five infantrymen, they're on their way back.
No. I'm going to do that when I get on the ground. Will, I was supposed to get a Columbia recertification briefing in the car. Are you in a position to do it up here?
That statue says it's got to be in person.
That Columbia is an ally in the drug war. So what's the plan?
At night?
Is that gonna work?
All right, let's get this over with and land.
Is it down?
Why not?
What's next?
How close do we fly to the tower?
At what altitude?
And we just can't stay up here for a couple of days and wait till there's a moon?
What else?
Larry, would you go back and mention that to C.J.?
Is cocaine production in Columbia up or down?
And how many of our extradition requests have been honored?
None.
Any good news? Anything we can hang our hat on?
That's good news?
What they spend it on? If you tell me coccaine…
So, I recertify them in recognition of the fact that they took our anti-drug money and went to Seaworld.
All right, leave that stuff with me.
How many times-- seriously, Leo-- how many times has the Black Caucus on retreats, at dinners… how many times have they…? There was a dinner two years where the Vice Chairs literally pulled out a map of Africa. They wanted me to make Africa a priority. And now they're making me look like a idiot.
Well, now they want me to make Brooklyn a priority. And when did these guys become Smoot and Hawley? Hang on a second.
[to Leo] Jessie Weiskopf's coming down, and he ain't smiling.
Okay, and how long do you think this'll take?
An hour and 15? Where are we?
All right, pretty soon though, we got to stop just flying around.
This is starting to qualify as space travel now.
The Falcon couldn't get a visual read, so we're going to buzz the tower at Andrews in a Boeing 747. Weiskopf says it's going to be an hour and 15 minutes. I'm going to call the families from up here of the five guys.
Thanks.
Will.
I'm going to call the families now. They're going to send up some information. Can you help me out?
Just give this to C.J. You should read it on the way.
Do me a favor. Find out what happens if I don't certify Columbia. Find out what happens if I decertify Columbua.
If I'm going to be up here, I may as well do something.
The fly-by's going to take about an hour and 15 minutes. Would you tell C.J.?
We lose some money.
Right, but at the moment, I'm more concerned with our credibility. He told me at the Summit of the Americas that he'd work toward crop diversification. Did he mean opium and coke?
Yes, but he's not helping us, so why should I give him political cover? Listen, I'm serious. What would happen if I don't recertify Columbia?
I can't what?
Why? [thinks] Because the deadline was midnight…
The actual signed paper?
This is really how the world works.
I want this plane to land!
All right, thanks.
