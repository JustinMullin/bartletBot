Why are you so eager to get in this game?
Seriously.
This is a cash game, Debbie. These are hard working people blowing off some steam and taking each other off their coin. We don't play for matchsticks and we don't play…
…Okay, can I ask you something? I forgot to have Charlie to draw cash for me, can you float me a little?
Leo, C.J. swears that on the equinox, which is today, you can stand an egg on end.
Yeah, you can play.
Where?
Well that's why these are unmanned right? All we lost was money? Aren't they saying detonate the plane?
Well, what do they want me to do, call Chigorin and ask if we can go in and get our spy plane back?
Wait, you're serious. They want me to call Chigorin?
And ask him for the plane back without telling him we were spying?
[sarcastically] Do they?
Hang on.
Yeah, this isn't going to work.
You're fine?
[knocks on the table] Check.
You were full of crap. You had jack-high or something?
Hang on. Will, why are you dressed like an officer in the Air Force?
You're a reservist?
I didn't know that. [to C.J.] Did you know that?
I had no idea. What do you do?
And this is your weekend up?
Well good for you. Where are you stationed?
They're ready?
[to Will] Play my seat.
Are we getting somewhere?
And what do I do when Chigorin tells me that Hawaii's not really part of America, and he wants to change the alphabet to Cyrillic?
[sighs] What the hell.
What area are we trolling in?
Yes.
We were spying for him?
Okay, this phone call you're going to set up with Chigorin…it's like for a White House bloopers reel or something?
All right.
Yeah.
Are the two related?
[nods] All right.
What do we have?
[imitating Chigorin] But President Bartlet, we have a terrific search-and-recovery team. We'll just go get that plane for you.
"Our folks"? You really think I'd use those words with the Russian President?
"Much as I have to protect Kaliningrad, sir, which brings us to the question of what the hell were you doing flying over it?"
Did it?
What was the other mission?
I tell him it was an environmental mission?
Okay, and he's not going to want to take pictures of coastal erosion at Coney Island?
We were on an environmental mission for Finland?
That's what we've come up with?
Set up the call.
He's on?
Let's go. [picks up the phone] Mr. President, this is President Bartlet.
What the hell?
Okay, you know what, I'm going to have to call you back.
[to Leo] Bamboo, they want me to get into the motorcade.
What's going on?
I'm all right.
I was on the phone with Chigorin.
He's got code word clearance.
Was anyone in the room?
Nobody was hurt?
[to Toby] You all right?
[to C.J.] What about you?
[holding up two fingers] Will, how many fingers am I holding up?
I don't know if you've met Ron Butterfield, the head of my detail.
Where's Charlie?
But if he's heard what happened, he's going to be trying to get here…
No, I'm telling you that if Charlie heard there were bullets, he's going to overpower whoever's trying to…
Come here.
It's bulletproof glass in the windows, okay. You want to kill me, you're going to have to do it from inside the building.
I'm surprised your guys managed to keep Fiderer in her chair. I would have thought she'd be the first one through the d… No, here we are.
No one was hurt, someone shot at the press briefing room from the sidewalk.
Will's sitting right outside, and Toby and C.J. are standing right there.
Yeah.
This was just a crazy guy, Leo.
Come on.
You guys playing again?
President Chigorin, it's Jed Bartlet again. I'm sorry about being abrupt before, but I bet if you turn on CNN international right now you'll see…
Yeah, there you go. It's not a big deal, but they shut us down for a little bit.
By the way when they crash the building they don't crash all of it. The Situation Room still works.
Mr. President, a little while ago an unmanned B-UAV drone crashed, we think somewhere inside Kaliningrad, as a matter of fact. Apparently they don't respond, you know, quite the way you'd like when there's a sudden shift in the weather.
Well, like I say, it was a UAV, it was taking satellite pictures of coastal erosion in the Baltic Sea. The Finns know about this. We'd like to send a special operations team ten kilometres west of Borsakova to retrieve it.
I'm sorry, sir?
Are you getting that translation right?
You campaigned on the environment, Mr. President. Coastal erosion in the Baltic Sea.
Well, the problem is our UAV's have a self-detonating capability and our people know how to disarm it, and I wouldn't want to put your guys at risk.
It's proprietary technology, Peter.
I know it seems…
Yes, Mr. President.
This isn't working anymore.
Peter…
I understand. I meant… [covering the mouthpiece] He's yelling at me pretty loud now. [into the phone] I wasn't referring to the change in weather, sir.
Don't do that Peter.
We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad.
We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We take pictures of black market nuclear materials being moved out the back doors of suppositories and into trucks. The materials are being sold to non-governmental elements and, well, that's what we were doing. Rogue engineers, military scientists, and ex-KGB. It's just as big of a problem for you as it is for us, but you're not dealing with it, so we were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We're going to have to trust each other a little Peter. So we're going to share the pictures we got. Not the technology we used to get them. Otherwise I'm detonating it and neither of us see the pictures. We're going to have to trust each other. Our two countries have stopped the world from annihilating itself for 60 years because of conversations like this one. Why don't you talk it over?
If he calls back we'll have a deal. In the mean time, one hand. Bring your wallet.
Hurry it up. They're going to call us back in a second. Debbie, do something.
Thank you. Is the pastrami from Krupins?
Tissue paper thin?
[under his breath] Damn it.
