How were they able to rent a van?
[reading a note] "A torrential downpour in the Pacific Northwest."
"A torrential downpour."
And they're just missing?
The five of them, they're just missing?
We're going to work on that?
Threat Con Bravo. Find them. Threat Con Bravo. Leo and I will be back.
[into phone] Thanks.
Yeah, listen, I don't think this is going to come as a galloping shock to anyone here, but last May I ordered a Special Ops unit to kill Abdul Shareef, and that's what they did, and we we made it look like what got reported.
See, I said we took Shareef, and they said fine, and then you went on talking for another five, ten minutes.
Yes?
Well, I just ordered Threat Con Bravo, so people are going to be seeing some heightened security this weekend.
We did.
Tell him, sister.
Oh, hey, Toby, big day.
The house, a masterstroke. Come on, give us a kiss.
Okay.
Yes?
No, I don't need help.
Yeah… I need help.
What I have?
Well, it's been said that I have a pleasant speaking voice and oratorical style.
On paper?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah, right away I would think.
Except at this minute, I have to go over and meet the agents who are beening detailed to Zoey for France. They speak French. As well as being secret service agents. I didn't mean they speak French and so therefore are guarding Zoey in France.
I have been thinking that I'd like to talk about creativity. Why don't you get started on some thoughts, and I'll join you.
Hi.
Are you friends of Zoey's?
Hey.
Wes, thanks so much for doing this. I know it's not what you like.
So, let's talk about how this is going to work.
Well, here's my question. These guys look pretty young to me, and I'm looking for something very specific with this detail. This is a father-daughter situation, and so what I think I'm looking for in terms of protection would best be categorized as, well, overwhelming force. Do they have that? Do they have the ability to just overwhelm any danger that might…? Do you have overwh…? Do they have overwhelming force?
Wow!
This one here tossed Wesley like a bag of potato chips.
You guys know each other?
Oh, good. Okay. Well, Ellie's still up and running.
When do you start?
[to Zoey] Are you going back to the campus?
Okay, well, let me ask you this. Would you consider instead of living in France with your boyfriend for three months, staying here, living in your room, being a candy striper, or surfer?
Or surfing? You could spend the summer working in a pet shop. We could play Yahtzee, and watch movies at night.
What daughters would do their whole lives if I had my way.
[to Wesley] Before I forget, if something comes up and you're faced with the choice of killing the boyfriend or not killing the boyfriend -- kill the boyfriend.
[to Wesley] Excuse me.
What's the registry?
What are we doing on the ground?
How long have they been at it?
All right, let's give them another hour. Then have the Coast Gurad close the port. Is it the port of Portland? Is it really the port of Portland?
They're going to lose $700 million a day 'cause these five guys are missing. And I just now got why we're having this meeting.
Portland. Torrential rain in the Pacific Northwest.
Screw the hour. Let's close it down.
Thanks.
Well, it's about the last thing they're going to get to decide. So you choose Tuesday. 20 years later, look what happens.
Good! You're here! I want to make some changes.
Look at you. There is no way you have three adult children.
I do, but the neck…
Eh, it seems empty to me. Attention should be drawn to it.
Nice job with the, you know, raising of the kid.
They're real, too. They can cut glass.
Aw, damn it, what are these, then?
Yeah. Get in the car. We'll do it on the fly.
Get in the car…
Small ones-- instead of talking about the internal muse, I want to talk about the limits of reason, and about passion and intuition in American life.
You can eat them, too. They're gumballs. Coop?
Yes. Let's think.
What do you think about using the Eudora Welty quote instead of the Gandhi?
"You must be the change" - is that it? "You must be the change you wish to see in the world." Sounds too much like Eastern philosophy.
'Cause Ghandi lived in India?
Well, let's write that one.
Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks, Will, for the help.
Thank you!
Yeah, no. I've got it down here in this folder, and on some napkins in my pocket.
Oh, yeah, I'll be fine. You know, unless something comes up.
Well, for instance, I just realized I don't have access to my pockets anymore. But, you know, what are you going to do?
