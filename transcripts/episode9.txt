I heard we may have…
I can call him?
It's done?
This is huge. Which one of you is the man?
Mrs. Landingham, let's make the phone call!
Thank you. You too. [They shake hands.]
Thank you.
You're too young to retire, Joseph.
[chuckling] Yes sir.
He's on the short list.
Yeah.
We'll make our announcement on Thursday.
I haven't made a decision yet, Joseph.
Mendoza was on the short list.
That's not true, Joseph.
Excuse me, sir…
I suppose we should get out there.
I'm sorry Joseph, but I am…
You've said quite a few words.
Let's get out there.
Joseph, when the next seat opens up, I promise you…
In three years, I would hope to be running for reel…
That's a little pessimistic, Joseph.
You know I imagine the view from your largely unscrutinized place in history must be very different from mine. But I remind you sir, that I have the following things to negotiate: an opposition Congress, special interests with power beyond belief, and a bitchy media.
Well, I am not Harry Truman.
[beat] It's 'Dr. Bartlet,' your honor. Now, let's go start your retirement.
A quick confirmation's gonna be good for us.
That's a blowout, Leo.
Just what the doctor ordered. [An agent opens the door.] Thank you.
Good morning, Mrs. Landingham.
When is Harrison getting in?
Good.
Good morning, Charlie.
Peyton Cabot Harrison. Find out what kind of cigars he likes, what kind of perfume his wife likes, and have them sent over to their hotel, okay?
Yeah.
We're using back channels. What is going on with Lillienfield?
Fine.
We're gonna get this done, right?
All right.
I'm on my way.
Thank you.
Leo?
We looked at everybody, right?
The short list. We looked at Mendoza?
Leo…
Yeah, you're right. I'll see you later.
Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.
Good morning. Good morning. Hang on a second.
Good morning. Keep your seats.
Good morning.
Good morning, Toby.
Do this for me. Put together some information on Roberto Mendoza.
No. I just want to be able to know something. There's gonna be a lot of questions. I don't want it to be 'we had a Hispanic on the short list.'
The reason we didn't go with him.
Let's do better than that.
Uh, what's going on with this drug thing?
All right. I'll trust ya. Thank you.
Good morning, Sam.
Here's an interesting statement. [reads] 'I join Judge Black, insomuch as while enjoying my privacy, I am compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless specifically prohibited by some specific Constitutional provision.' Unquote.
Why isn't this ever been brought up?
We spent two months vetting our homerun nominee, he doesn't believe in a privacy guarantee, and it never came up?
[pause, sighs] When does Harrison get in?
I want him first thing in the morning.
When was the last time either of you slept, I don't care. Get ready for this.
Excuse me.
I want to meet Mendoza.
Judge Harrison, first thing's first, are you the author of this unsigned note?
When I was 26, I wrote a paper supporting the deregulation of Far East trade barriers. Nearly got thrown out of the London School of Economics. I was young and stupid, and trying to make some noise.
I'm gonna bring Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn in here and talk about this a little bit.
Okay. Charlie, please?
Peyton, do I have the right to put on an ugly plaid jacket and a loud polka-dot tie and walk down Main Street?
Where in the Constitution is that right guaranteed?
What about the use of cream in my coffee? Surely, there can be no free speech argument to be made there?
So you have no objection to the state of New Hampshire passing a law banning use of cream in coffee?
As I lose the votes of coffee drinkers everywhere.
This Sam is young, drives me nuts too, but he took you off for a ride, sir, because that's what I told him to do.
I understand, Peyton. Could you give us a little time, please? We'll make you comfortable while you're waiting.
Thank you.
You don't think the guy who called Sam wouldn't know how to call a senator's office?
Toby?
I'm sure we're almost done. Sam, what else you got?
You need me, Leo?
Would you excuse me?
What is it, Leo?
Lillienfield?
He knows?
We?
What does Josh say?
Josh is a smart guy.
We used to be too.
Did you have a drink yesterday?
Are you gonna have one today?
That's all you ever have to say to me.
You fought in a war, got me elected, and you run the country. I think we all owe you one, don't you?
Did Harrison get off okay?
Why?
I'll bet it has. [turns to Sam] Do you have any more questions, Sam?
Toby?
Judge Mendoza, would it surprise you to learn that for the past few months, your name has been in the short list of candidates for the bench?
Well, then this is gonna knock your socks off. Tomorrow evening at 5 o'clock, I am naming you as my nominee to be the next associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. You were not the first choice, but you are the last one, and the right one. [beat] Will you accept the nomination?
Good.
Thank you. Sam and Toby will be in charge of your confirmation.
What do you say, Leo? You up for a good fight?
Good. Let the good fight begin.
Mr. Justice Mendoza!
