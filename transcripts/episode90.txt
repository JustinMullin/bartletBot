(Sullenly) We're having a good time here, too.
Talking about the too rapid passage of time and, you know, grieving.
I told you it was this one!
That's the day we brought her home from the hospital. Tell me that wasn't a month ago. What the hell is she doing graduating summa cum laude from something?
Do you have my older daughters? Do you have Ellie and Elizabeth?
What is it they're gonna want? Bahji prisoners freed? We get out of Qumar? We get out of Kundu?
And Union Station, too? We shut down Union Station?
I'm gonna check on Abbey.
You and me both.
Yeah.
Blood tests?
In low doses, it's a date-rape drug.
What about the boy?
Where is it?
We think this is Zoey?
Where was it faxed from?
(reading the translation) "Release Uzma Kalil, Ahmed Mansour and Barmak Essa from the Islamabad maximum-security prison. The President will announce on television that the United States will abandon its military presence in Qumar."
Where are you?
Move the 5th Fleet into the gulf.
One?
When do you want me to give the order? Seventy miles from the target? Sixty? Fifty?
How far away do I wait?
Seventy-seven hundred's an emergency frequency?
Fellas, we've got confusion in here!
When do I give the order?
(to Leo) Talk to me.
I know you wanna get the planes in the air. I wanna think about it a minute, okay?
I don't know what to do about the military options. Nancy's making good points. Sorry about the confusion in there. I know we practiced that.
I don't think so. I need you to tell me now. Do you think she's already dead?
If they show me a picture of her alive and tell me to aim cruise missiles at Tel Aviv, they're counting on the fact that a father
(turns to Leo) I might.
How about a picture, they've got a knife to her throat, get out of Saudi Arabia?
All I CAN think of are images like that.
Leo. Please listen to me. Did Fitz give me target recommendations a little while ago?
I don't remember having the conversation and I don't know what targets he wants to hit. Did I green-light the targets?
I know it's a strange time to bring this up but I forecasted this once. I made up a scary story a few years ago for Zoey so that she'd take her protection seriously, and I went too far. And I scared her. And she cried. This was the story. Leo, the people you just named don't have the legal authority to stop me from doing certain things and some of them would go to jail if they didn't follow my orders. Very quietly, I want you to assemble the Cabinet. I want you to call the Speaker of the House.
availing myself of the constitutional option offered to this office by Section Three of the 25th Amendment which permits, through written declaration, to temporarily transfer all powers of the presidency to the next in the constitutional line of succession.
The article doesn't require the unanimous consent of the Cabinet, but I want it. I want it as clear as can be that this administration stands squarely behind and shoulder to shoulder, with the acting president.
I won't be giving any orders.
Leo would know what to do.
Yes.
Secretary of Commerce?
Secretary of Veterans Affairs?
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development?
Secretary of Health and Education?
Secretary of Agriculture?
Secretary of the Treasury?
Secretary of Defense?
Secretary of State?
Secretary of Labor?
Secretary of the Interior?
Mr. Speaker.
I find out the gun that killed Molly O'Connor was bought through a loophole, so help me, mother of God, Glen
Does he?
Huck?
Nice. So, what do you know now that you didn't know before?
Ha. Yeah. (smiles) They also come with those little theft-protection devices. Those little LoJacks on their ankles so they can't be boosted from the hospital. Man, don't even let them take it off (smiles).
All right, let's get organized. I've got two letters. One removing me from power, the other reinstating me. I'll sign the first. And then the justice will swear in the speaker, and I think Leo's right. The first thing is, how do we announce this?
Glen, they've been up all night.
(to Madam Justice Sharon Day) Swear him in.
